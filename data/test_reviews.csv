"My very good friend who have suffered a terrible loss, started this process quite a while ago. To date, she is being constantly stalled, security breaches in relation to her personal information, GDPR. She has on numerous occasions asked to speak to a senior member of staff and keeps getting fob off. She still has not had a pay out.

I will now be seeking a removal of my funds from Nest as I have now lost total trust in them and I will be contacting the agencies that I work for to consider moving the staff pensions elsewhere.","senior staff##Customer Support##keeps getting fobbed off##negative[SSEP]data security##Transparency & Communication##security breaches, GDPR violation##negative[SSEP]complaint process##Process & Onboarding##constantly stalled##negative[SSEP]trust##Trust & Reliability##lost total trust##negative[SSEP]fund access##Fund Management##not had a payout##negative"
"IMPOSSIBLE to sign up. filled out employer sign up about 20 times and always get the message ""URL rejected, contact your system adminsitrator and some error code""
when talking to nest, this seems to be a common problem and i was advised to delete cookies (did that), change browser (did that as well), change device... BUT the web site is fine (and that this would happen only sometimes, to very few people on the weekend when website would be maintained)
i am thinking about changing pension provider.
NEVER seen a problem like this in my whole life

UPDATE: did try a different device and this isn't wokring either. Well done NEST! Way to go (bankrupt).

UPDATE: nest pension answered with ""need to improve"" and ""take into consideration""!!!! THIS WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING. This needs to be fixed.

i am still waiting for nest pension support to solve this (7 days after)

NEW UPDATE: Finally success! i was able to sign up, but by no means on advice of the support line (phone or web). by pure luck i tried my personal e-mail (hotmail). which worked - as it doesn't contain a special character (my work e-mamil is admin at xx-xxx.com).
I am leaving my rating:
1. in the first place this restriction is RIDICULOUS. if anything, a hotmail, gmail account is less secure in this context than a corporate e-mail - anybody can get it.
2. the sign up page checks all kinds of similar senseless restrictions on passwords (cant' have a "".""), PINS (no two consecutive can be the same), but NOT on any e-mail.
3. i guess my employees have to sign up wiht their personal e-mails as well.
4. NO support was aware of any of this. after FIVE hours of trying i stumbled across this.
5. the Trustpilot reaction from nest pensions was very poor.
whoever designed this should get four weeks of closed door training and review their guidelines on security restrictions","security##Account & Access##review##negativeemployer sign up##Process & Onboarding##impossible##negative[SSEP]support##Customer Support##no support was aware##negative[SSEP]website usability##Website & Usability##not working, senseless restrictions##negative[SSEP]email restriction##Account & Access##restriction is ridiculous##negative[SSEP]Trustpilot response##Transparency & Communication##very poor##negative"

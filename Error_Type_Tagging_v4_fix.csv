"IMPOSSIBLE to sign up. filled out employer sign up about 20 times and always get the message ""URL rejected, contact your system adminsitrator and some error code""
when talking to nest, this seems to be a common problem and i was advised to delete cookies (did that), change browser (did that as well), change device... BUT the web site is fine (and that this would happen only sometimes, to very few people on the weekend when website would be maintained)
i am thinking about changing pension provider.
NEVER seen a problem like this in my whole life

UPDATE: did try a different device and this isn't wokring either. Well done NEST! Way to go (bankrupt).

UPDATE: nest pension answered with ""need to improve"" and ""take into consideration""!!!! THIS WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING. This needs to be fixed.

i am still waiting for nest pension support to solve this (7 days after)

NEW UPDATE: Finally success! i was able to sign up, but by no means on advice of the support line (phone or web). by pure luck i tried my personal e-mail (hotmail). which worked - as it doesn't contain a special character (my work e-mamil is admin at xx-xxx.com).
I am leaving my rating:
1. in the first place this restriction is RIDICULOUS. if anything, a hotmail, gmail account is less secure in this context than a corporate e-mail - anybody can get it.
2. the sign up page checks all kinds of similar senseless restrictions on passwords (cant' have a "".""), PINS (no two consecutive can be the same), but NOT on any e-mail.
3. i guess my employees have to sign up wiht their personal e-mails as well.
4. NO support was aware of any of this. after FIVE hours of trying i stumbled across this.
5. the Trustpilot reaction from nest pensions was very poor.

"My wife has a very small pension to be taken as a small pot. The website just didn't work so she's been trying to get the small amount back on the phone. She's been promised the money will be paid out three times now, filled in forms and sent her marriage and birth certificates off twice. The calls are always answered by someone with a difficult to understand accent on a faint crackly line. The person always says this isn't my department but I'll try to help and then they don't and we go back round the merry go round again...
 Utter, utter frustrating crap.
 
 You might be happy with them handling your pension but woe betide you if you actually want YOUR money out.

"Terrible. Whilst polite, the customer service team will do nothing more than offer a call-back if you raise an issue - chances of that call happening are around 1 in 10. Allow a few extra months if you are planning to withdraw your funds, they seem to want to keep the pennies for as long as possible. No idea why??
 If you need to speak to the support team you should expect a few hours of repetition and contradiction. The online chat is even worse; the operators can't be bothered, in my experience, to read the context of the conversation before jumping in and repeating the FAQ content of their website, verbatim, with the escalation option being a call-back 24-48 hours later.

"1. Lack of ability to do partial transfers
 
 If you are a contractor or in certain professions often times Nest is the pension provider that is in use. If you have a SIPP then it can be difficult to go through with the transfer process as partial transfers are not permitted.
 
 This can cause such a big headache. You have to close the scheme meaning that you miss out on employer contributions - you then need to organise the movement of the funds out of the scheme and shut the scheme.
 
 When the scheme is reopened you do not have the previous history and have to reset everything up.
 
 I have experienced this taking an exhausting amount of time and that time difference can have a large impact on returns - yes even just a month. I have had to transfer out of many different providers - L and G, AON, Aegon and Aviva aside from Nest. Nest was the most difficult to deal with and took the longest to organise the transfers. In my husbands case we actually had to complain to a third party.
 
 2. Lack of transparency
 
 Considering the default enrolment for so many it would be good to show the performance against other relatively stable choices on the platform e.g
 
 S & P 500
 VHYL
 Vanguard Lifestrategy
 Other Target Date funds available from Vanguard or Blackrock available on popular SIPP or investment platforms
 
 3) Breath takingly expensive fees
 
 This platform when compared to some other providers would be considered extremely expensive. There are a lot more cost effective options and Nest should be made to post comparisons against other major platforms online to give consumers a better understanding of the impact fees can be having on their returns.
 
 4) Doesn't connect to budget apps like money hub
 
 5) Really limited choice of funds
 
 6) Not enough on the platform or not enough
 outreach to let consumers know how much of a difference each fund can make to their retirement.
 
 e.g someone aged 25 will miss out on a substantial sum by going into the lower risk fund. Considering the value of the state pension and what many would need even for a minimum retirement more needs to be done here.
 
 7) You can only pick one fund type
 
 There are limited funds but why can someone choose say 10% in lower risk, 45% higher risk and 45% sharia funds. Why only one - for how expensive the fees are why are the red carpet treatments not being rolled out?
 
 I would really like to see the government step in and make improvements .",fees##Fund Management##breathtakingly expensive##negative,Correct

 7) You can only pick one fund type
 
 There are limited funds but why can someone choose say 10% in lower risk, 45% higher risk and 45% sharia funds. Why only one - for how expensive the fees are why are the red carpet treatments not being rolled out?

"1. Lack of ability to do partial transfers
 
 If you are a contractor or in certain professions often times Nest is the pension provider that is in use. If you have a SIPP then it can be difficult to go through with the transfer process as partial transfers are not permitted.
 
 This can cause such a big headache. You have to close the scheme meaning that you miss out on employer contributions - you then need to organise the movement of the funds out of the scheme and shut the scheme.
 
 When the scheme is reopened you do not have the previous history and have to reset everything up.
 
 I have experienced this taking an exhausting amount of time and that time difference can have a large impact on returns - yes even just a month. I have had to transfer out of many different providers - L and G, AON, Aegon and Aviva aside from Nest. Nest was the most difficult to deal with and took the longest to organise the transfers. In my husbands case we actually had to complain to a third party.
 
 2. Lack of transparency
 
 Considering the default enrolment for so many it would be good to show the performance against other relatively stable choices on the platform e.g

 When the scheme is reopened you do not have the previous history and have to reset everything up.
 
 I have experienced this taking an exhausting amount of time and that time difference can have a large impact on returns - yes even just a month. I have had to transfer out of many different providers - L and G, AON, Aegon and Aviva aside from Nest. Nest was the most difficult to deal with and took the longest to organise the transfers. In my husbands case we actually had to complain to a third party.
 
 2. Lack of transparency
 
 Considering the default enrolment for so many it would be good to show the performance against other relatively stable choices on the platform e.g
 
 S & P 500
 VHYL
 Vanguard Lifestrategy
 Other Target Date funds available from Vanguard or Blackrock available on popular SIPP or investment platforms
 
 3) Breath takingly expensive fees
 
 This platform when compared to some other providers would be considered extremely expensive. There are a lot more cost effective options and Nest should be made to post comparisons against other major platforms online to give consumers a better understanding of the impact fees can be having on their returns.
 
 4) Doesn't connect to budget apps like money hub
 
 5) Really limited choice of funds
 
 6) Not enough on the platform or not enough
 outreach to let consumers know how much of a difference each fund can make to their retirement.
 
 e.g someone aged 25 will miss out on a substantial sum by going into the lower risk fund. Considering the value of the state pension and what many would need even for a minimum retirement more needs to be done here.
 
 7) You can only pick one fund type
 
 There are limited funds but why can someone choose say 10% in lower risk, 45% higher risk and 45% sharia funds. Why only one - for how expensive the fees are why are the red carpet treatments not being rolled out?

My name and date of birth are the same on both systems Nest queried my name first of all which delayed me about a month, they then queried my date of birth another month delay. (Why didn't they check the details together). These were both correct already!! You don't get any updates from them so I complained to Nest who were quick to contact me by phone but the lady didn't give me any information as to what was going on or why it was taking so long. The latest thing is Nest will wait until you are not putting money into your pension anymore. I messaged them on their messaging service to say I wasn't. A few weeks later they contact you to say you have to go into the app to press a button to confirm you are not still paying into Nest, more delay. The latest delay tactics is they have now told me I must wait 10 days before they will transfer the money to my Standard Life account as this could be a fraudulent transaction!! After all the hoops I have had to jump through and all the details going through a secure system this absolutely stinks of deliberate, unnecessary delaying tactics. This process has taken over 4 months which should in this day and age taken a couple of days. Disgraceful.

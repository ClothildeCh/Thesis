"1. Lack of ability to do partial transfers

If you are a contractor or in certain professions often times [Company X] is the pension provider that is in use. If you have a SIPP then it can be difficult to go through with the transfer process as partial transfers are not permitted.

This can cause such a big headache. You have to close the scheme meaning that you miss out on employer contributions - you then need to organise the movement of the funds out of the scheme and shut the scheme.

When the scheme is reopened you do not have the previous history and have to reset everything up.

I have experienced this taking an exhausting amount of time and that time difference can have a large impact on returns - yes even just a month. I have had to transfer out of many different providers - L and G, AON, Aegon and Aviva aside from [Company X]. [Company X] was the most difficult to deal with and took the longest to organise the transfers. In my husbands case we actually had to complain to a third party.

2. Lack of transparency

Considering the default enrolment for so many it would be good to show the performance against other relatively stable choices on the platform e.g

S & P 500
VHYL
Vanguard Lifestrategy
Other Target Date funds available from Vanguard or Blackrock available on popular SIPP or investment platforms

3) Breath takingly expensive fees

This platform when compared to some other providers would be considered extremely expensive. There are a lot more cost effective options and [Company X] should be made to post comparisons against other major platforms online to give consumers a better understanding of the impact fees can be having on their returns.

4) Doesn't connect to budget apps like money hub

5) Really limited choice of funds

6) Not enough on the platform or not enough
outreach to let consumers know how much of a difference each fund can make to their retirement.

e.g someone aged 25 will miss out on a substantial sum by going into the lower risk fund. Considering the value of the state pension and what many would need even for a minimum retirement more needs to be done here.

7) You can only pick one fund type

There are limited funds but why can someone choose say 10% in lower risk, 45% higher risk and 45% sharia funds. Why only one - for how expensive the fees are why are the red carpet treatments not being rolled out?

"Worst pension provider. Trying to leave them and take my pot to another provider but I am constantly faced with issues. Due to NESTâs failure to provide accurate information, my pension transfer has been delayed by 4 weeks. Which is unacceptable, as it is my hard-earned money, and I should not be penalized by incorrect calculations or employee errors. I am also concerned about the apparent lack of training or knowledge among NESTâs customer service team regarding fundamental pension processes. When I spoke with a [Company X] representative who, unfortunately, had no understanding of the tax relief component. Despite my repeated explanations and references to the total contribution amount, she insisted that I was mistaken and refused to acknowledge the discrepancy. Her inability to comprehend the issue and her dismissive attitude left me feeling frustrated and deeply dissatisfied.",customer service,Customer Support,lack of training,negative,Y,1.0,Y

"I initially left my [Company X] pension pot untouched for years because they offered a 100% equities fund, which aligned with my investment strategy. However, with their decision to shift towards ""safer"" assets, I decided to transfer this pot into my SIPP. This is where the frustrations began.

[Company X] requires proof of ID to be sent, either as originals or copies signed by a solicitorâan outdated and cumbersome process. Iâve transferred other pensions online with far less hassle, so this was disappointing.

After sending my ID, I received another message a week later requesting the same documents. I went through the lengthy phone security process to speak to their offshore transfer team, only to be cut off within two minutes due to a poor connection. After repeating the process and speaking to someone again (on the same terrible line), I was told the system sends automated reminders if IDs arenât processed in time and that I should ignore them. Frustratingly, immediately after the call, I received a text telling me to resend my ID!

This entire transfer process has been unnecessarily painful. Based on this experience, I would not willingly choose [Company X] as a pension provider. If their transfer-out process is this difficult, I dread to think what drawing my pension at retirement would be like.

EDIT: After writing the review above, I waited for the transfer to process, but nothing happened. When I contacted them again, I was informed that I needed to print another form, fill it out, and send it by post for additional ""security"" checks. Why couldn't they tell me this when they processed the first form? As some other reviewers have pointed out, this seems like a deliberate tactic to delay the process, potentially discouraging customers from completing the transfer altogether.",transfer,Fund Management,where the frustrations began,negative,Y,1.0,

It has now been a week since my last review, and I am still waiting for my ill health payment to be credited.

As expected, Iâm still chasing and waiting.

I want to highlight that I spoke to one genuinely helpful person, Rob from the complaints team, who understood the issue and promised to expedite the payment. Unfortunately, his words have not translated into action.

Itâs frustrating that I canât even respond to the standard copy-and-paste replies [Company X] gives to reviews like mine. If youâre considering using this service, I strongly advise you to look elsewhereâget your money to another provider who values their customers.",,,,,N,1.0,

In order to beat the fee and inflation, you need noticeable growth - but [Company X] appears to make this as difficult as possible by not giving you adequate choices in which to invest. My pension has been with nest for a year so far, in that time VWRL (my SIPP fund of choice) has seen a 23% increase.

I wish that I could give zero stars. [Company X] are a diabolical company to deal with. There investment strategies are poor so I decided to transfer my funds. They got difficult and quite nasty as a company. I eventually sent a letter telling then that it was my money and I want it transferred as soon as possible. They responded with a very blunt and quite nasty text message informing me that they have transferred my fund and Iâd receive a letter. Iâm now contacting the FCA for advice. Why the government chose nest is beyond me. They charge expensive fund management fees for a poor return. Iâd recommend anyone in moving their funds out of [Company X].,,,,,N,1.0,
I spent weeks trying to transfer my pension to a new one but they deliberately made it difficult so I couldn't. They were asking me to send them a bunch of documents such as my passport by post.

After all the checks finally were done trough a bank statement letter with a stamp on it, Iâm still waiting. Receiving a letter from this company saying theyâre going to pay in 5 working days, it was expected last week, Tuesday, the 28th of October. This week I call them again, cos 2 weeks passed and they said there this time is some technical issue but the money will be in my account tomorrow, Friday, the 8th of November.
Well, Iâm quite sure this is not going to happen as I not have any notice from my bank saying that the payment will take place tomorrow.

Update 16:35 - rang [Company X] and was told that I will receive my money by the end of the working day today. I explained the previous person I spoke to told me not until 15th November. She told me that is half the people. This is not happening just to you. Lots of people are in this position. Half we are paying today and the other half by the 15th. But the calculations are wrong, so you will also get a letter correcting the amounts and a new P45. Where are you other people?! Letâs call [Company X] out! Get them in the news! Checked my bank again and NO MONEY! I have waited a month for my money now!
I notice that whoever reviews the comments does not do anything. [Company X] I urge you to step in to sort my problem out and get my money for me. You have all my information because I submitted that at review.
It is now Friday 8th November and no money has been received into my account. Looking at past reviews I am increasingly worried about getting my money at all! I would urge people to think very carefully before using them.
I spoke to [Company X] Tues 22nd October to take out my pension. I was told the administration of this would take 5 days. I have received nothing! I rang this morning 6th Nov at 8am and spoke to a British lady who assured me the retirement team would call me because the money had been sent but due to a glitch in the system it never went through. It was re-sent on the 3rd November. This lady gave me dates and amounts and as much information as she could. I rang my bank and they have no record of any funds going through. I waited until nearly 10am and rang the retirement team at [Company X]. I got through to India call centre and was on the phone 50 minutes. The lady came back and all she could tell me is I will receive the money by the end of the week. No date. I had to push her to tell me the amounts and when they were sent. She seemed to think it was sufficient for me just to know the end of the week.
I asked to be put through to Peterborough office and I got more clarification from them again than I did India. The payments went through twice and bounced back due to a glitch in the system. They have gone through again and I should receive them by the end of the week.
I made a complaint because I feel that once [Company X] got information that the payments bounced back they should have told me. In this day and age we are all worried about scams etc and it is a worry waiting for money to come through.

Been with nest for years never had any problems but trying to get them to help with problems is a nightmare 1 st phone call could not understand anything being said to me was a nightmare 2nd call was a bit better has my problem been resolved the answer to that is no. I finally got a advisor who was helpful and did not hung up on me after i said I wanted to speak to a manager I am still waiting for a manager to contact me and for my issue to be resolved the advisor who helped me was fantastic like I said I am still waiting for nest to give me a explanation.

I have no faith with nest going forward I have learned my lesson if anyone have a pension with this lot and you pay into it and u want to put more money in to it by direct debit donât bother because this is were it went wrong for me you try to improve your pension and nest make it difficult for you god knows what I am going to when I can take money out as I donât trust nest at all I wish I gave them one star as thatâs all they deserve.Having a reply from nest when I first posted this I have to laugh as they say they value the relationship with me but thatâs a lot of rubbish nest donât care about me they never have done and never will I donât value nest never will I will just get a reply the same as before just ring us and we will help what a load of rubbish.,,,,,N,1.0,

"I am extremely frustrated with [Company X] as it is the only pension provider available through my workplace, yet theyâve made a decision that restricts my investment options. As someone in their mid-20s, being all-in on equities is ideal for long-term growth, but the only full-equity option [Company X] previously offered has now been removed.

The alternative, NESTâs Higher Risk Fund, has delivered 43.4% returns over the last five yearsâquite a contrast to the 123% achieved by the discontinued all-equity Sharia fund. This change will cost UK consumers millions in potential returns, especially when no suitable alternative has been provided. Why not simply add a new fund rather than remove the current one? Itâs my pension, and I should have the right to invest as I see fit without being forced into their limited fund options.

My goal is straightforward: I want my pension invested in low-cost index funds that track global markets. This shouldnât be difficult, but NESTâs choices make it frustratingly so.

Additionally, moving funds out of [Company X] isnât possible without closing the entire account, meaning weâre essentially locked in if we want to receive employer contributions. This setup feels restrictive and monopolistic.

The customer service experience has also been disappointing. It took over an hour of back-and-forth with representatives just to get information about the new Sukuk fund, which is apparently ""HSBC Global Funds ICAV - Global Sukuk UCITS ETF.""

***

Good afternoon,

I wish to open a complaint about the appalling, discriminatory service Iâve received from [Company X], and to cash in my pension.

My pension was set up by [redacted], and then transferred to [redacted]. It is with seemingly huge misfortune that Mr [redacted] entered my date of birth incorrectly when registering my pension with his company [redacted] and that [Company X] failed to notice the error- because as a result I now have two [Company X] accounts, one registered with my correct date of birth and a second with the incorrect date of birth.

On 06/10/24 I phoned [Company X] to consolidate the accounts and cash them in, a process I naively thought would be relatively simple.

The [Company X] advisor I spoke to on 06/10/24 said he would email me a form to update and consolidate my pension accounts, but this never materialised.

So today I phoned [Company X] again and spoke to Sam from the Peterborough office, reiterating the problem and my wish to cash in my pension.

Sam told me that I needed to sign up online to access my account. Whilst still on the phone I tried to do this, but despite entering my details correctly multiple times (please see attached screenshots), I kept receiving the same error message stating my details were not recognised.

When I explained this to Sam he told me he would send a form in the post to consolidate my accounts that way. I informed him that he would need to update my address as I no longer live at [redacted], but in response I was told that I canât update my address without accessing my account!

So I need to access my account to update my address, but I canât update my address until Iâve accessed my account! Quite the dilemma.

At this point I was beyond frustrated, and asked to speak to a supervisor or manager. Sam agreed to do this but instead transferred me back to the main switchboard where I would have to re-enter all of my details again, and explain my situation for the third time to a new advisor!

This is completely unacceptable. I am diagnosed with a plethora of debilitating mental health conditions including ADHD and PTSD which leave me with very little patience and make these kinds of drawn out, frustrating processes unbearable.

Due to my mental and physical health I will not be in a position to work again, and am entitled to the pension that I have worked for. It is MY money. If necessary, I can provide confirmation of my health status from my GP.

I ask that you facilitate the transfer of my pension/s to my bank account expeditiously, else I will have no choice but to contact the Pensions Ombudsman to complain, leave a review on TrustPilot and every other available platform, and seek to instruct a lawyer to take matters further. You have over [redacted] of my money and are withholding it unjustly. I am furious.

Please consolidate my accounts, and update my personal information with my correct date of birth which is [redacted], and my new address which is [redacted].",customer service,Customer Support,dire,negative,Y,1.0,

Considering that [Company X] Pensions are dealing with many people wishing to access their hard earned funds, it was a difficult process for us.

"[Company X] is unbelievably challenging to communicate with as an employer. I've had issues recently with schedules for new employees being rejected for no apparent reason. [Company X] insisted that the accountants were responsible even though there was clear evidence that it was [Company X] who had rejected the schedules and that the information in the schedules was correct. I've also recently had it where schedules were submitted on payday, accepted within 24 hours, paid on time and then, miraculously, something ends up being changed (in [Company X], not with our payroll or the amounts being paid), and even though no monies are owed, we still receive threatening emails about late submissions.

Being able to talk to someone is easy. The live chat is very quick. The trouble is that the advisors don't know the system very well and are clearly using some form of translation software because the answers often don't make sense with incorrect words being used. (Example from today: ""Five days payment don't taken""). I can live with that, but it's impossible to find a solution when they don't understand the system, so you end up going round in circles. More than once, I have ended the chat and started a new one, hoping to get someone else to help me.

Finally, almost none of the system is automated. You can't just submit the schedule and allow [Company X] to take the money. You have to submit it, wait for it to be accepted, log into your account, confirm the numbers are correct again (I can guarantee that the payroll system will be a lot more accurate than my maths), and then permit the direct debit to be processed. It's such a long-winded, needlessly complicated system, especially as you have to wait for everything to be accepted, so you can't do it in one go.

The [Company X] Saga continues. I have now got 5 employees wanting to ""opt-out"" of [Company X], but being ignored and therefore having to cease contributions. The operator asked that I encourage my employees to opt-out before the expiry date...however this is an automatic contradiction to the governments workplace pensions statutory law.

Had to back-date up 5 months of submissions because one of my employees finally managed to opt-out by phone. Problem is neither my employee or [Company X] informed me of this. They claim it is my duty to check with the messages in my inbox on my account for this as they are not allowed to email me for GDPR reasons. This is understandable. But they have neglected to email me to even tell me there are important messages in the inbox that needs attention. Note I have 192 messages and each time I would need to download a PDF to just read the message.

Not only this...the letter I received does not even have the necessary information for me to process the request and had to manually call them up and go through 6 minutes of security questions to then be told something I should have been told earlier. Quite frankly this company is a mess and I have heard of many complaints. It is a shame this is a government approved company and we have no choice to use them. There are others, and will be considering the difficult process of moving everything across.

However, the recent announcement on 14th October [PhoneNumber] regarding changes to the Sharia fundâspecifically the inclusion of Sukuk bondsâhas been quite disappointing. The shift away from a fully equity approach undermines the core reason I originally chose [Company X].

Unfortunately, with no alternative fully equity-based fund now available, I feel [Company X] no longer supports my investment strategy.

"This is a warning I will NOT be calling you on [PhoneNumber] -SO DON""T BOTHER TELLING ME TO CALL OR CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICES.
I explained my disability needs at least 5+ times and YOU still refuse contact with your Diversity manager.

DO NOT SEND ME POST AGAIN WITH WRONG DETAILS, FIX DETAILS THEN POST ME OTHERWISE EMAIL WHICH RICHARD HARDY REPLIED TO ME WITH GENERIC RESPONSES ALREADY.
You have been instructed this way long time ago and you keep doing it, this is a form of harassment and also outing special category data!

So this a way of contact you, deal with it.
I am under severe stress and anger issues and you have contributed greatly to my decline by your s**t handling of things.
I have recorded medical needs I struggle with oral communication, I NEED WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

You harass me after me pointing your wrong doings, I make sure it is visible here

START LISTENING and record stuff accurately.

'You're unhappy with the time taken to process your transfer request and our requirements to update your personal details'
Which is not why I am complaining about.

You are already know what are my issues, but you refuse to acknowledge them after tons of live chats, emails and so on:

1. Holding my information incorrectly (GDPR ISSUES + POSSIBLE DISCRIMINATION)

e.g. Title see on letter attachment they have it as down as Mr to indiscriminate me.
Title does NOT REQUIRE LEGAL information to change, I demanded for you to change it, you keep harassing me and refusing to change it.
My mother personally picked up this letter noticing this and this caused confrontation between us.

I ASKED YOU TO STOP SENDING ME POST UNDER WRONG PERSONAL DETAILS DUE TO CREATING TENSION BETWEEN ME AND FAMILY, WHY WON""T YOU UNDERSTAND AND CONTACT VIA EMAIL LIKE AEGON DOES - STOP WITH 'FOR YOU SECURITY SAKE, for GOD SAKE YOU BROKE LAW HOLDING MY DETAILS INCORRECTLY ALREADY.

You don't have to do much, not changing titles because bigotry or simply NOT GIVING S*** about people's wellbeing - it's only $ for you

You breaking the law here holding wrong information after being informed to change it.

2. I demanded erasure of my data from their systems as I do not give active consent due to my Fraud situation, [Company X] holding data incorrect (title etc) (GDPR ISSUES)

[Company X] claims right to hold my information for 15 years, I do not consent as I was forcefully signed into [Company X] by employer and as young stupid kid I didn't knew better of consequences in the future when I want to leave [Company X].
I am harassed by fraud calls and identity issues very routinely and I have legitimate reason to try to remove data from companies that are not trustworthy.

3. Discrimination against disability users (EQUALITY & DIVERSITY ISSUES)
I already mentioned how [Company X] REFUSES to accommodate disabled users in reasonable way (email communication) and refuses on the basis 'Security of identity when you already fail at security big time'
I demanded access to upper management and the disability manager, personally emailing those people and hearing nothing.
I also asked staff to pass their details so I can discuss this, but I was denied.

For comparison AEGON has accommodated my disability needs in a reasonable way and allowed direct email conversations, THERE IS NOT SECURITY RISK COMMUNICATING VIA PERSONAL EMAIL, IT""S AN EXCUSE!

4. Company is heartless and customer service almost non-existent, the lack of empathy in service is out of ordinary worth complaining on its own
Those people simply do NOT listen, by far the worst company I encountered in my life and that says a lot.

-Misinformation: Agents lying there is no support email to contact [Company X] (I went on web and found it myself

-Agents saying different things all the time such as you need this document, other one saying other document, next one saying totally something else.

-Lack of empathy and listening skills
Are you human or drones?

-Refusal to speak to higher ups
What are you hiding, should have no issues?

"I have a small amount in a [Company X] pension and, in order to make my admin easier, I decided to transfer it to a larger pot with the People's Pension. I have already transferred a very small amount from an Aegon pot to the PP on with no problem at all.
I have had several letters to my online [Company X] account stating that they ""need more information"". This all relates to making a statement that I have reviewed the option of using Pension Wise for advice. I have an independent advisor and do not feel the need to use Pension Wise for such small amounts - I have done my homework and checked the comparative charges.
With the first request I was asked to make a statement but there was no form attached. I called the [Company X] team and was advised that they were happy with my response to this request over the phone and that they would proceed without a form.
I received however another request for this information a couple of weeks later. This time there was a two page form, which I was asked to complete and return. No problem with doing that, except that there was no place on the form for me to enter any personal details. I realised that, if I had sent the form back to them, then they would have no idea who had sent it.
I called again and pointed this out and I understand that this issue was then notified to their team. In the end I completed the two page form and sent it back together with a copy of the letter itself, as that contained my name, address and membership number.
I am concerned that once again an organisation has come up with a ""system"", which does not work as it should, and that no-one has spotted the flaw. Are these processes not tested? This is not a complaint as such but simply a plea for organisations to understand that they must test these things out in the interest of better customer service.",customer service,Customer Support,,,Y,1.0,

"EDIT: Customer call centre has been entirely unhelpful when trying to resolve issues - both employer and employee have called several times and every time advice given is different. No one take at this company takes ownership of any issues - they will just fob you off. Like the author of the response - who had clearly ot even bothered reading the review.

As for the website - I urge anyone contemplating using this company to have a look at the lengthy and detailed help section - do you want to spend your time following these unnecessarily long and complicated steps to do anything on your account. Avoid frustration and headache - opt for a company that actually wants to work with you in a friendly and helpful way. [Company X] is not one.

Be aware!

The payroll company we use to pay our carers for my disabled daughter uses this company and I would not recommend them to my worst enemy.

The system is complicated and it is proving impossible to get accurate advice from them - I have tried messaging, chat and telephone line several times. The telephone advisers adopt truly a ""computer says no""approach. Every call different advice is provided. The information on the website and by call handlers are different.

With both Social Care and NHS pushing people for personal health budgets and direct payments there will be lots of people who are not business owners having to deal with these companies. If you are one of these people having to use a pension company because you are managing care payments for your loved one, look for another one.

"I've been using [Company X] for my workplace pension, and overall, the experience has been frustrating. The interface is clunky and difficult to navigate, but that's just the start of the problems.

The fees are ridiculousâ1.8% upfront investment fee plus an additional 0.3% annual fee, making it a total of 2.1%. Most workplace pensions donât charge such draconian fees. Iâd rather pay the 2% National Insurance and invest my money where it can grow better without these unnecessary fees eating into my savings.

Account management is equally disappointing. [Company X] enforces a strict password policy that doesnât allow you to set your own password, even if it meets the security standards of banks, trading platforms, and other pension providers. Plus, thereâs no option for two-factor authentication, which is an essential security feature nowadays.

Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that my employer offers this as the only option, I would have switched long ago. I can only hope that the government eventually mandates employers to contribute to pension schemes of the employee's choice, so I can leave this service behind.


UPDATE: major pension providers charge 0.15% - 0.5% fee. you can really settle for 0.25%

"Wanted to transfer my pension out of nest to another provider for consolidation purposes and nest have made it a right PITA. For some reason they want two copies of my original docs, drivers license or passport to be sent to them. Likely chance I'd never receive them back due to ""getting lost in the post"" and end up having to pay 140 for replacements. If you send copies they need to be signed by people like nurses or barristers or head teachers etc, a very specific list.

I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO WORKS IN THOSE JOBS.

It's my effing money! Yet they're acting like they own it, frustration, anger, the fact they're fleecing me? Shocking state of affairs. Scottish widows had no issues transferring my pot to another provider but with nest it's like pulling blood from a stone.

Terrible terrible company, if I work anywhere in future that uses nest for pensions if I can't nominate my own pot I'll quite literally decline the job offer. What's the point if you have 0 control over your own money that you've paid in to your own pot!?

JP Morgan's Nutmeg tried to initiate a pension transfer in my name, [Company X] sent out some documents that I filled out and returned to them, they coming up with some new nonsense now to confirm my identity, original ID documents either be sent to them via mail or copy of original ID to be signed by certain type of professional. The whole time I am the owner of both pots they have on my name for years, yet I have to confirm my identity as a random request, even though I got the (wrong?) information via online chat, that I won't need to do anything after submitting the requested document and my transferring out process will continue automatically.

Result: SUCCESS!! ð¥³ My money has FINALLY been paid to me.

"On the 23rd May [PhoneNumber] I contacted [Company X] in order to facilitate the transfer of an ex-employer pension fund out into my preferred supplier. I do this to consolidate all employee funds into one place where I can control the investment. They responded to advise that the DOB they have on their system does not match what I have told them. My previous employer had input the correct DOB. [Company X] asked for proof of ID - duly submitted in the form of a scan of my passport (on the same day).

I subsequently hear nothing. I then contact them to ask what has happened, and they advise as my new Employer (unfortunately) also used [Company X] that the two accounts need to be merged before I can transfer the old fund (no longer receiving contributions making it eligible for transfer) out. In order to merge the two accounts information is requested - duly provided on the 30th July [PhoneNumber].

Silence again ensues aside from more emails asking for further ID to be sent. I call them on the 9th August [PhoneNumber] to ask what is happening and they initially state they have not received the form (which was sent on NESTs own system...) which I direct them too. But now have to send them the proof of ID again... Despite the fact they had it back in May, and it will literally be the same scan as it was before. I would have complied (because we all love bureaucracy) yet I asked the question, ""I hope that when the accounts are merged I can transfer the old-Employee Fund out and it won't affect the new-Employee fund?"" (As I fully understand that whilst contributions are being received into a Fund - it cannot be transferred anywhere.

I am told no - as long as I have an active Fund with [Company X] I apparently cannot transfer any funds out. Old or New - despite them being two separate member accounts and it is only by sheer coincidence (and bad luck) that both employers use [Company X].

So now a halt occurs to the entire process - I do not want that old-Fund merged with the new-Fund (I never did to begin with - I simply wanted to transfer the now, inactive and non-contributory Fund out to my preferred provider!) and a Formal Complaint raised and a Subject Access Request (SAR) over this entire process, which will be escalated to the Pensions Ombudsman if required.

If you're an Employer - please do your staff a favour and pick one of the other providers out there - every other organisation has made the process seamless...

"Based on my personal experience, I strongly advise against trusting [Company X] Pensions with your money. Despite [Company X] advertising its FCA-regulated status, in practice, it operates without meaningful oversight when it comes to how they handle your pension funds.
Major Issues with [Company X]:

Untrustworthy Investment Practices: If you decide to transfer out, buy an annuity, or take a lump sum, [Company X] will de-invest your funds during market dips, causing you significant financial loss. They deliberately de-invested my pension during a market slump caused by the Yen carry trade sell-off, then delayed transferring the funds until the market recovered. This manipulative timing left me financially disadvantaged.

Excessive Delays in Transfers: [Company X] takes far longer than other pension providers to transfer funds, which can lead to missed opportunities and financial losses. Their processes are frustratingly slow, and their constant delays add unnecessary stress to what should be straightforward transactions.

Incompetent Customer Service: The help centre staff lack basic financial knowledge and are unhelpful in resolving even the simplest issues. My experience with their customer service has been nothing short of abysmalâthey ignored my formal complaint and failed to address my concerns appropriately.

Poor Platform Functionality: Their website is clunky, outdated, and difficult to navigate. Simple tasks like checking fund performance or finding essential documents are unnecessarily complicated. Unlike other providers, [Company X] doesnât provide clear transaction details on the purchase and sale of funds, leaving you in the dark about how your money is being managed.

Access Denied to Essential Information: [Company X] informed me via email that my pension statement was available on their portal, but they revoked my access on the same day, blocking me from retrieving critical financial documents. Despite repeated requests, they refused to email me my statement and only offered to send it by second-class mail, which is unacceptable for such sensitive information. To date, I still havenât received it.

Ongoing Communication Failures: Even after blocking my account access, [Company X] continued to send me emails notifying me of new messages in my account, which I cannot view. This level of incompetence and disregard for customers is infuriating.

A Private Pension Adviserâs Warning: My private pension adviser warned me about [Company X], but my employer insisted on using them. This has been the worst financial decision forced upon meâIâve had far better experiences with other pension providers who are transparent, efficient, and respectful of my needs.

[Company X] is, without a doubt, the worst pension provider I have ever dealt with. If you value your money, avoid them at all costs. Their handling of my pension has been nothing short of negligent, and their customer service is incompetent and obstructive.

REGARDING RESPONSE BELOW:
Thanks, but here we go again!
You have my [Company X] details and account number, as I had to submit them to place this feedback, so your comment about security and keeping my identity safe really does not hold water.
We both know phoning up would entail all of the above experiences yet again. Eg: explaining everything from scratch, put on hold and transferred, resulting in some lame stock answer.

"So, my partner this morning received a letter from nest, requesting proof of my ""passing"", well, I can confirm that I'm very much alive and kicking. So that brings up an issue, who reported me as being dead. This is concerning as my partner and I are the only two people in the world that know I have a nest pension.

So, on to the phone, where a very polite chap informed me, after a ten minute wait, that he could not help with my current issue and would pass me to the ""correct department"". Well, the next thing I'm greeted by is a dial tone. Thanks for that. So back on the phone, after much pressing of keys, I ended up at the back of a queue that was 15 minutes long... Life is too short for that, even when I'm allegedly dead. So, onto the live chat, somwhere in India.... After explaining my issue, the gentleman asked me for the email (bear in mind I had explained that my partner had received a LETTER IN THE POST THIS MORNING, ugh, so, after he got the idea, he then told me (and bear in mind this is through nests own site) that he cannot help me as this was an ""uninitiated chat"" and would not be able to discuss anything related to my account. SERIOUSLY, what the hell is the purpose of the live chat, if not to discuss account issues!!!!!!!

So, he gave me an email address and, I have now written to them this way to hopefully get a response. I have a feeling that I probably will actually be dead by the time they give me any pertinent details.

So, if your partner / significant other has received a letter saying you are dead, first up, check the mirror, you never know ð¤£, secondly, don't bother going to the phones are you'll waste what years you have left in a queue, and, definitely don't go onto the live chat, as I'm pretty sure that the staff on there are dealing with 20 people at the same time and don't even bother to read your issue, and certainly won't be able to help with your account enquiries as it's an ""uninitiated chat"" whatever that actually means. Instead, they do have an email address, find that and use that, life is too short to be sitting in a queue or being routed to India.

"I think the fund options are quite badly labelled. It would be nice if the Sharia fund wasn't the only 100% stocks fund as younger people cannot take advantage of a longer time horizon compared to other options like investing into an ISA where there's more flexibility to choose what you want.

Overall [Company X] is okay their fees are high but I'm more concerned about their fund options as even the ""Higher Risk Fund"" is not 100% stocks and still includes bonds and not a lot of people would see the ""Sharia"" fund as appealing until you start to look into the distribution between stocks and bonds if you are looking for 100% stocks with no bonds.

It would also be a good idea to provide more education on pensions too. Most people don't change their fund (myself included until a year ago) and I would have massively benefited from an email every now and then reminding me that I don't have to just stick to the default.

Edit: I've changed this from 3 to 1 star. I used to invest in the Sharia Fund as it was the only 100% Equity fund but they're changing this now so I'll likely be moving my money elsewhere to get more exposure to equity as I do not want to invest in bonds.",,,,,N,1.0,

WHY DO COMPANIES SEND OUT BOG STANDARD EMAILS INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUES ? look at the reply below.we have been in touch again since & before getting the weak sub standard from nest pensions.this customer nestpensions advisor said they were having problems not us trying to log in.they are now sending details out via post something we try not to ask anyone to do ( save the planet).let's wait & see !

Here's a thing you have to pass security using loads of id which is great they then tell you that you have passed security.they have sent one email to my wife to tell her that she can check / withdraw her pension,then all of a sudden her email is not valid ?

I was enrolled with them by my employers and i got savings with them, I wish I never ever been enrolled with them . I started the process of changing my surname in May, it is July now and still it is not completed! 2 months! I had keep ringing, talking with different people, until I wrote official complaint. After official complaint I thought it was sorted. But no! Yesterday I received the message from them by asking to send my deed poll which I already sent... I had to send it again. Their mailbox allows to send 1 document at time. I had to send them separately.
I just have no energy to deal with them anymore. It's so poor, the service is poorest I ever had to deal with someone in my life!

My wife is attempting to transfer out her pension fund. She has supplied - and has had her payroll department supply - all requested information. In the case of the written forms, these were sent by tracked mail, and have been received.

No response from Pest, so my wife has contacted them by phone, only to have a scripted conversation with extremely unhelpful customer disservice agents, who say that they haven't received the documentation and send further copies of the same form which my wife has already returned to them.

Interestingly, all of the 5 star reviews are ""invited"", and are referencing transferring in to Pest (don't do it!), rather than the experience of accessing your money. So don't trust the headline rating ; the real value is much lower - possibly even negative.

I love Nestâs ethical fund principals and three stage management, and its performance has been competitive, but more communication during the transfer process would have provided much greater peace of mind.

"Since joining this Government managed/promoted scheme in Sep 21, despite inflation running well in excess of Government targets, it appears from my annual statements that my pension fund is not making any money (and is therefore actually devaluing due to rampant inflation). Nevertheless, the opening gambit in the email inviting me to have my say said 'we've worked hard to grow your money'. I cannot see any evidence of any hard work or growth! I have contributed significantly (via salary sacrifice), my employer has contributed and I have received tax relief...so my pension pot has grown, however, in Year 1 the actual value of my investment was -Â£27, in Year 2 it was -Â£350 (data from annual statements for 21/22 and 22/23). Contribution charges at 1.8% and additional management charges on 0.3% might appear reasonable - but not when the total annual charge exceeds any growth in that year. Just what are we paying these 'invisible' and clearly unaccountable managers for?

I have yet to see my annual statement for 23/24 but for the first time since joining the scheme, it actually does look like my pension pot is finally bigger than the total of paid in contributions by me and my employer. However, I remain unimpressed with the fund performance to date and I have discussed finding a better pension scheme with my employer as [Company X] really does not appear to be working for the pension member.",,,,,,1.0,

"Awful experience with nest - they are happy and responsive if you keep your money with them however horrendous if you want to move it.
Iâve had my pot with them for years and upon looking properly at my statement, I saw it was making a loss each year so I decided to move it.
To do this you have to complete a form which they make you print (I donât have a printer) and sent a form of ID.
I wanted to ask them to send a hard copy and also to ensure theyâd send my ID back recorded delivery - chat function doesnât work on laptop or iPhone, no one answered the phone and no response to my 3 messages via my account.
Theyâve now messaged to say the form I sent them wasnât signed (it 100% was - I had it checked before I sent it) and that I need to send it again, no mention of the ID I sent them.
I canât wait to move my money away from them and would not recommend. I notice they donât reply to their 1* reviews here to try and resolve like other companies do - sums them up",,,,,,1.0,

"They have call centers in India that will put you on hold for a minimum of 20 minutes and then speak to you for 5 minutes. They keep transferring you between departments, using jargon like ""EOD"" (End of Day). When you ask which country's end of day they mean, India or the UK, they give vague assurances that the money will be in your account and you'll receive confirmation. I've seen another user fall into debt because of this, and I'm facing similar issues. This company has no moral obligation towards its customers. If I could, I'd rate them -100. They are absolutely ridiculous, disgusting, liars, and cheats. They've given me three different dates claiming the amount was credited, but when confronted, they avoid giving straight answers by saying they're not allowed to. I believe the UK financial authority should investigate them. Delays are one thing, but lying to customers repeatedly is unacceptable.

Dear Sir/madam


Since the 4th May. I have been trying to get you to release my full pension fund â and as of today, it appears I am back where I started. To say that your customer service is terrible is an understatement!!
After at least 10 phone calls â countless emails, it appears that none of your staff are capable of being upfront, being honest and actual providing a service.
On the 4th of May I requested to withdraw my funds from the pension I have with [Company X] and the information requested was provided.
On the 8th of May I called your contact number and spoke to a guy called Suliman who confirmed everything had been received and my payment was being processed.
On the 8th of May I received an email confirming you have received my bank details.
I called on again May 13th, 14th 20th, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 31st and today 3rd June chasing up payment
Initially when I decided to pull my funds out, I was told what information I needed to provide â I am a sole trader and the account I supplied was a business account. Only after a period of 10 days or so was I told you wouldnât accept a business account for payment â why was I not told this when I initially called and when I followed up.
On the 22ns May I sent you an email of complaint and also attaching another copy of my bank personal bank statement, a copy of my driverâs licence, a copy of my passport and clarification of my NI number â¦.. again!!!
During this process and sometime after my initial request and conversations I was told that you would not accept my sole trader bank account details â you have now a private bank account that should have facilitated payment.
If you look at my case noted and listen to the calls that have been made you will understand my frustration at the incompetence of dealing with members of your staff in the call centre
Furthermore, my complaint is as follows:
â¢ It is not possible to speak to a senior manager â they are either busy, canât be contacted or havenât started work when I have called â I believe that is a complete lie.
â¢ Your staff have not followed up on my requests, they have not kept me informed and they tell conflicting stories about why the payment has been delayed â more lies
â¢ I have been told twice that everything has been processed and I still have not received my payment lied to again!!!
â¢ Your support email address can take up to 10 days to be answered â utterly ridiculous in this day and age! What sort of âsupportâ is this!!!
â¢ There is no customer service email available.
The service provided by nest has been an utter sham, and there is certainly an element of dishonesty from your staff who seem utterly incompetent of actioning anything to do with me chasing payment.

Last Friday 31st May I spoke to one of your operatives â I told him I wanted a call back from a manager â I did not receive a call â today I have called again and again asked for a call from a manager â letâs see what happens????
I have never in my life dealt with such a difficult organisation who have lied, misled and have not followed up on my complaint.
From a customer point of view it appears the last thing you want to do is speak to or help a customer in a timely manner
On experience I doubt anything will be actioned as [Company X] seems completely unable to provide a service
I look forward to a response although given my experience so far, then I donât expect anything of substance from you
Perhaps my next action will be to visit your head office!

"It has been almost a month and I still haven't been able to start a withdrawal.
First they wouldn't accept my son's bank account, even with me giving permission and providing all the details, each email I received had the same generic response, the response on live chat was just ""you will have to open a bank account"" without providing any alternatives.
I have now opened a bank account in my name and still the system couldn't verify the details and is again asking for further proof.
I go in to compose yet another message and receive a pop up advising me ""live chats are the quickest way of solving problems"", when I start yet another live chat the agent tells me that I have to compose a message, which was what I intended to do before the system advised me to start a live chat.
On the page that asks for further documentation I was advised to print some sort of cover letter on a link, clicking on said link just takes me to a ""page not found"" page, which is a really good look on your company, I must say.
I have now sent whatever documentation I have to prove the account is in my name, all this to withdraw money that is mine... I am never putting my money in nest again.",,,,,,1.0,

Update 1 :

Thank you Sarah - but there are vast number of poor reviews on Trust pilot are when customers are trying to transfer their funds to another provider but you seem to either ignored that feedback and ploughed on using such onerous and laborious processes.

"I think the nest pension is good in the way it grows from both employee and employer putting money into your pension pot.

Also how it grow further from further voluntary contributions which you can adjust or even suspend for a time if need be so there is a bit flexibility. There is also a small extra bit on top through tax relief.

The only potential negative for me is that it's a devine contribution I.e. an investment rarther than a devine benefit pension which gives a lump sum so there is a more potential risk. The amount you receive in the end is can only be predicted rather than a garenteed amount.

At least an investment type of pension may give you more as a grown investment at least in theory.",,,,,,1.0,

"As an employer navigating the maze of pension schemes, my experience with [Company X] has been nothing short of a nightmare. Initially, everything seemed fine, but the illusion of competence quickly shattered when my direct debit mysteriously vanished into the void of bureaucratic oblivion.

Attempts to rectify the situation online were met with frustration as the system repeatedly failed to process my requests, leaving me in a perpetual state of financial limbo. And let's talk about communicationâor rather, the lack thereof. [Company X] seems content to rely solely on the ancient art of email (which often ends in the junk folder), oblivious to the existence of more immediate and reliable forms of contact like letters, texts, or phone calls.

Their website, if you can even call it that, is a digital labyrinth plagued by bugs and design flaws that would make even the most patient user scream in agony. It's like navigating through quicksand while blindfolded.

But wait, it gets better. After multiple failed attempts to pay my contributions due to their own incompetence, [Company X] decided to escalate matters by reporting me to the pension regulators faster than you can say ""autopilot."" It's as if their entire operation is running on autopilot, with no human oversight or accountability in sight.

In a last-ditch effort to salvage some semblance of sanity, I lodged a formal complaint online, only to be met with deafening silence. No acknowledgment, no resolution, just the void echoing back at me.

And now, here I am, spending my Friday night tethered to the phone, desperately trying to speak to an actual human being amidst a sea of automated prompts and hold music. The first representative conveniently blamed a ""bad line"" for their inability to hear me, despite my crystal-clear signal.

To cut a long story short still not done been lied to continuously and i am no where nearer to drawing on pension. Apparently the help desk, complaints and back office support has been out sourced to a company called TATA Consultancy Service which makes me wonder if [Company X] directors actually know how bad the situation is regarding their service.

Update due to [Company X] response. For your information those checks were completed and approval for merging the accounts - after checking all of the documentation provide by me to prove my identity - was given in early April [PhoneNumber] (and subsequently on several other occasions when chased) but because of incompetence it was never done until 19 May [PhoneNumber]. The fact its has taken [Company X] until today to actually respond - via this site - with quite inadequate explanation proves a point. Maybe if you took customer service more seriously this would never have been an issue. Out of interest when are you going to respond to my complaint or are you conveniently ignoring that point?

Second update 21 May [PhoneNumber]. [Company X] keep sending me messages which i can only access via my account which surprise surprise has been locked and I cant access. One message header said we are still dealing with your compliant and I am gobsmacked that its taken them this long just to say that (4 weeks). Received a text message on 20 May [PhoneNumber] that payment will be made in 5 working days but i am not going to hold my breath. As long as I am paid by pension I see little point in further dialogue. I will just complain to The Pensions Ombudsman and let them deal with this terrible unresponsive organisation",,,,,,1.0,
"This provider is worthless. You get automatically enrolled in a so called pension, that is supposed to be transportable if you move jobs. But in reality it is not user friendly if you are a temp, because each time you move roles, after 3 months you get re enrolled under a new membership number. They donât seem to be able to recognise that your NI number is already active, so you end up with multiple silly little pots. You then have to prove to them that you are who you say you are by sending your passport to them so they can move the pots into one. And donât even think about trying to opt out, very difficult. I am 65, told them I did not want to join, but a smug guy told me it was for my own good and tried to explain what a pension was. Iâm sure I would build up a huge pension in the 6 weeks until I retire. What a waste of time. I now have to try and get out of this distopian mess, again.",,,,,,1.0,

"Awful pension provider.
1. Charges a massive fee of 1.8% to pay in to your own pension, immediately diminishing your pot and potential returns.
2. Is completely opaque - you have no way of seeing what they are supposedly investing your pension in.
3. Once you decide to transfer out, they limit your account access so you can't see your contribution history or value of the pension pot (got to take their word for it I suppose...). The only access you have is to historical messages and previous years' reports.
4. Is not truthful in its communications to its customers. [Company X] sent a letter on 30 April stating that my pension transfer had been completed and the pot moved to my new provider - new provider confirmed over a week later on 8 May this was not true, and that [Company X] was still completing ""final checks"". Called [Company X] today, and was informed this is indeed the case, and I might get a call back in the next 1-2 days to let me know what's going on, but with no guarantee of an answer.

Go to Aviva or anything other because [Company X] is the worst possible option for a normal person. It takes ages to get any sort of information from them.

"Absolutely nightmare that company, communication, information .... trying to withdraw money from that company is ridiculous experience!! Don't use it at all!!!

Update after [Company X] responds:
Best asked for bank account statement to be sure about correct bank account. After 2 days I received request to send it via post as security test failed, test for bank which received several times title the best bank in the UK. When [Company X] received my bank statement by post, 3 days after asked me for more information, without any specification what they are looking for. So I had to call them to get info that letter has been sent with request for information, so another delay as letter is still on the way, for 5 days now. Long story short, itâs 26 days from my request for payment!!!
No, I did not change my mind at all!

"I have been trying to opt out of this pension for years - which I never opted into in the first place but was stuck with it via an exam board I no longer work for putting me into it!

Today, I tried again after several years of giving up.

I waited for over an hour to get through to their phone line - this was after writing to them about a month ago and explaining my plight in detail. I received a reply today which told me to use the phone number!

I spoke to a person who could not update my email address. No matter how many times I told this person the new email address, they got it wrong. As a result, I was still locked out of my account when I tried again later. My password update has been sent God knows where.

The person I spoke to claims to be sending me an Opt Out form in the post, but I have no idea if they have sent it to the wrong address as I had to try many times to explain my address and there was very little coming back from this person.

I tried the chat line but that seems to be public and you get scolded for entering any personal info like your name!!!! They knew nothing anyway.

I just want to close this unwanted and unasked for account down for ever but that is proving impossible.

I am now into my 8th year of trying to close it down.

"I have a real problem with the workplace pension scheme and [Company X].

I pay in + AVC's
My employer pays in.
The Government pays in in the form of tax relief although they will take that tax relief back by taxing my pension when I start to draw it, how obscene is that? (you couldn't make it up)!

My pension fund ([Company X] Sharia Fund) does well for a week or so, gains a thousand pounds in value then the next week it tanks.
This process repeats month in month out.

Again I ask, where does the money go and why are these firms allowed to effectively gamble with our hard earned money on the stock market which is such a volatile platform? A platform that can tank overnight when someone like Liz Truss comes along?
Just pray that doesn't happen again the week before you cash in!

We deserve a better system because once again the value of my pot has dropped. This time by Â£2k in the space of a few weeks despite another Â£500 being paid in.

So are the [Company X] fund managers inept (bet they still get a bonus and decent pension perks) or is the system just set against us simple working folk. The whole system is a corrupt mess IMHO and [Company X], if I was writing your report it would read, must do better.

There's nothing brilliant or outstanding about [Company X] but then again there isn't much choice when it comes to workplace pension schemes and the others are no worse or better. Strange that isn't it? That they are about the same makes you wonder what's going on with our money.....",,,,,,1.0,

Now think what this means for your pension, can you trust them?

Their whole game is basically running away and making it impossible to cancel your pension, which you didn't even agree to (government requires a pension provider needs to be assigned to inside contractors). Their tactics are so laughable, accidentally cutting the line and the like when you are trying to opt-out, and mumbling your [Company X] ID that you need to cancel. Pathetic.

"For a company specialising in British pensions and investments to have a call centre in Mumbai is not acceptable. Yes, they have HQ in Peterborough but you have to go through a great deal of turmoil, mumbo jumbo and lies to get to speak to anyone there.

I have had an ongoing situation with [Company X] since early January and trying to get it resolved is proving impossible, once a week they send a computer generated letter to my inbox saying my problem was ongoing and still unsettled.

The investment itself is performing at a less than an average state compared to my other pension investments, so not much to shout about there.

"Transferring my pension into [Company X] was surprisingly transparent and easy.

I had mental blocks about pensions for years as I didn't understand them, and spent years learning about them and making sense of them. Finally I had a tiny pension from a job I left quickly and it made no sense to keep it separate. Once I requested the transfer, [Company X] sent a list of questions of things to check that I had either understood or been advised about. I had no advice from a financial adviser as last time I did that, they wanted to charge me a fortune when all my small pension pots are tiny. So the list was very useful in deciding that I had researched and looked at all aspects when transferring a pension. Fortunately, I had chosen a straightforward pension to transfer out of, which meant there were few things to worry about, eg it wasn't a final salary scheme or had any guarantees.

Also, consideration needs to be taken on which pension to transfer INTO. I chose [Company X] as I can see the contributions that go in, and so can follow up if an employer has not paid in (as has happened previously). The charging system is simple, and I have flexibility to alter my retirement date. The tailing off for the pension pot going to cash towards retirement is about 7 years, which is reasonable, as the pension I transferred in was 15 years, and considering my age, this was an important factor as retirement is not as distant an event as it was when I was 20.

If you are looking to start a pension with [Company X] joining is a breeze and really easy, like so many others below I would give 5 stars, I have never had any reason to call them, so for 9 years I have been making monthly payments. UNTIL 2 months ago, when I received a simple email from [Company X] asking me to name a beneficiary, that is thoughtful of them, but I forgot my password, there is a password reset, but you get nothing back? I am glad this happened as I now could see what [Company X] Pensions was all about. Next you call them, you will be on hold for over 1 hour and even then the phone cuts off. Then you try CHAT , you get a message ""We are very busy try calling or log on"" Tried that over 2 months!! during which you will get 4 further beneficiary emails from [Company X] but you cant do nothing, each time you get one you waste over an hour trying to communicate with [Company X].

I cant put names of [Company X] employees on here, last review had the CEO full email address but google [Company X] Management board, you find all the board members names including the CEO, type the first name then type a dot then type the surname then type @nestcorporation.org.uk, then also send to secretariat. and support. at the same email. Now most companies that you email the CEO will have an Exec Customer service team that will intercept the email and deal with the issue, [Company X] is the first company that from the very top down , will ignore your emails. Even if you tell the board and CEO you will email every single day until you get a response (Dufrense Method) it took 3 days of every board member receiving my complaint before I got a call back, 2 months and 3 days later. I immediately requested all my pension be repaid back to me, you have to change your preference to POST not on line then they will send refund documents within 5 working days , Im still waiting. Lucky Im 58, if you are younger than 55 you wont be able to get repaid, so read above before starting your pension.

I have been trying to transfer out for 6 weeks. They keep purposefully trying to prevent by asking, at 10 day intervals, for new (previously unrequested) info/signatures/passports etc. Anything to delay.

To put in perspective L&G transferred out a sum 6 times bigger in 2 weeks and Hargreaves Lansdown transferred 'in species' funds (12 in total) in the same two weeks.
These guys are still doing their ""due diligence"" whilst not answering emails (2 in last week), keeping me on hold on phone for 40 mins then hanging up and when trying live chat, only every 5th line you type displays so they cut you off and suggest you call.

Little if any pension / tax key date understanding and given the end of the financial year is so important to their sector/customers this obvious lack of consumer duty focus was very worrying. I will be moving my pension pot from them as soon as I can as I do not trust them to be looking after my money or their ability to support their customers as their regulatory body would expect.,,,,,,1.0,

"Slow, confusing and contradictory information provided by different [Company X] staff. I have moved funds from 3 other pension companies into an annuity. All were seamless and done quickly, with minimal paperwork and a couple of calls. Trying to move my [Company X] fund to an annuity is proving very time consuming and frustrating. My annuity company requested the transfer of (MY) funds from [Company X], but [Company X] do not use the origo system that other providers use. [Company X] then send me a 12 page document to complete before they would release (MY) funds. I called [Company X] because I was unsure which forms to complete. I explained that I wanted to transfer my fund to an annuity. [Company X] team member then asked me what I was trying to do? Had to explain again! Told me I needed to speak with their transfer team but could not put me through. I had to dial in again and pick the transfer team option. I telephoned again and selected the transfer team. Spoke to a different [Company X] person, who transferred me back to the first person I spoke with! [Company X] person then advised me that they ([Company X]) had sent me the wrong forms and would send me the correct forms. This time they sent me 45 pages of documents to read and complete. Some of which needed to be completed by the annuity company. Why send them to me? I telephoned [Company X] again, [Company X] person told me not to use their secure email on their web site in my account, as it cannot cope with large attachments and to send the documents with a copy of my driving licence to a different email address. Got things moving, only to be told that I had to prove that I have had all my options explained to me by the Governments Pension Wise team (which I had already provided [Company X] with the reference number that Pension Wise gave me during my consultation with PW). Emailed [Company X] again with another form that I did not realise I had to tick a specific box. Why couldnât they call me and tell me. Another 8 days have passed and I am still awaiting for a status report that I had requested. Have received 2 emails today both stating that they cannot give me a status of my transfer request through their support mail box or on my private email address. And have told me that I have to telephone them ([Company X]) to find out this information. What a palaver !! All I have asked for is confirmation that my transfer is in progress and how long it will take. Multiple emails and telephone calls later and all this at my expense as I am losing my annuity pension money whilst [Company X] pontificate and keep asking for more information. Transferring money into [Company X] is easy. Transferring funds out is time consuming and difficult. Really poor service from [Company X]. I do not expect that anyone from [Company X] will read this either. FOLLOW UP from above: At last the transfer of my funds has been done. I put in a complaint to [Company X] about my experience. [Company X] have emailed me advising that I need to log into my [Company X] account on line to read their response. But, [Company X] have already closed my account automatically after transferring my funds. So I cannot access my [Company X] account to read the complaint information. Follow up to follow up: Still getting emails from [Company X] instructing me to log into my [Company X] account to see the status of my complaint. But [Company X] have closed my account !

"I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with [Company X], my pension provider, that left me feeling completely dissatisfied and disillusioned with their services.

For the past three months, I've been trying to opt out of the [Company X] pension scheme, but it has been an uphill battle every step of the way.

The opt-out process is needlessly complex and convoluted, with unclear instructions and constant delays.

Despite my repeated attempts to opt out, I have encountered nothing but excuses and roadblocks from [Company X].

One of the biggest issues I faced was trying to reach their customer service team. Their phone system is outdated and inefficient, requiring me to jump through hoops and provide numerous personal details before I can even speak to a representative. Even when I finally did get through,

I was met with more hurdles and requests for additional documentation, prolonging the process even further.
To make matters worse, the handling of documents and requests for information was a complete nightmare.

Despite submitting all the required documents as instructed, I was repeatedly asked for more proof of identification and documentation.

Even after complying with their requests, I received no response or acknowledgment from [Company X].


The final straw was when I tried to contact their support email address, only to find out that attached files are not accepted.

Despite sending the documents internally as instructed, I never received a response or any indication that my concerns were being addressed.

Overall, my experience with [Company X] has been nothing short of a nightmare. Their lack of efficiency, poor communication, and disregard for customer service have left me feeling completely let down and frustrated.

I would strongly advise others to think twice before entrusting their pension with [Company X], as my experience has been nothing short of a disaster.

In conclusion, [Company X] has failed miserably in providing adequate service to their customers, and I will be looking to take my business elsewhere as soon as possible.",,,,,,1.0,

"Because of the slow & bureaucratic methods employed when closing an account & transferring funds e.g. birth certificates & driving licences (not copies either) I managed to lose out on the annuity rate 30 day offer given by my provider and ended up having to take a much lower offer.

Then 3 weeks after my [Company X] account was closed it was closed for a second time with a nominal amount sent to my annuity provider. They, of course sent it back, because the annuity had already been bought (at the lower rate natch). Since then I & my financial adviser have spent the best part of 3 months trying to get this nominal amount transferred to my account

As someone has already mentioned trying to interact with [Company X]'s 'customer services' is a mind numbing depressing Kafkaesque undertaking. I have contacted them at least 5 times and each time had to explain the situation and each time was put on hold while they either tried to transfer the call or obtain information.

When they came back the information they had obtained was invariably the same information I had already provided at the start of the call. They then said we will have to call you back which in many case they didn't.

It appears the root of the issue is that they have to reopen my [Company X] account to put the nominal amount in from which it can be then transferred to my account. And after being put on hold for a further 15 minutes and told they would call me regarding reopening the account I lost it....

And told them that this is a situation of [Company X]'s making and to contact me when [Company X] has opened my account and is ready to proceed with the transfer.

To be brutally honest I am now wary of actually providing [Company X] with my bank [BankDetail] the transfer to be completed.

An awful, awful, company who patently has awful, awful internal procedures & communications along with awfully, awfully trained operatives.

Response to the Reply.

Doesn't the reply just emphasise the incompetence of the company. My complaint centred on the inadequacy of the customers services and the issue of not having a [Company X] account to complete a transaction.

So what is their recommended resolution? To call customer services or log into my account.... Did the writer not see what was just infuriating & hilarious & incompetent with this approach.

A previous workplace set up my pension with nest. I never received a policy number or any documentation from nest.

My aunt has been trying to get her funds since her birthday (retirement age in December) and sheâs still not been paid. They just keep making excuses. It was due to her experience that I decided to move my pension from them and lo and behold true to form theyâve taken my money hostage. And letâs be clear. The money you withhold isnât yours.

That may be due to the way the contributions are being invested or some other reason but I would certainly hope that will be the case at the date of my retrement.

Most impresive is however the choice of funds one could shitch to, e.g. choosing riskier or less risky inversment strategies, or even investments with no interests (Shariah principle).

By then my retirement date had passed and I would then be liable for income tax on the lump sum. In addition, [Company X] has an ageist policy of declining online communication after the age of 75, even though that would have been my preference! The last online communication I had was to inform me my new retirement age was 105! In February [PhoneNumber], I requested my lump sum, received a bulky sheaf of forms in the post, filled them, received another sheaf that looked identical to the last lot. No response. In May [PhoneNumber] I spoke to an operative on the phone. I found his attitude flippant and disinterested! Apparently I had to sign another form, he said he would send it-he didn't!!

I, with 42 years working in IT, challenge any [Company X] administrator to prove to me that the procedures adopted that cause all these complaints, ""are merely for security reasons"", as nowadays there is ""plenty"" of technology to do all the checks and transfer the money in a matter of seconds.

Even sites without control over other people's money, such as TRUSTPILOT, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and others, which would not have any need to adopt security checks and control systems, use them to please their customers and increase their credibility of its contents, technology and verification methods that are absurdly more efficient than those utilized on [Company X].

NO, that's not the point! ...lol..

A company with more than [PhoneNumber] employees, revenues of more than US$20Bn/y, takes a long time to transfer the money to its owners, it is not because of a lack of access to technology, it is not because of a lack of $$$ to implement more modern methods and procedures.

Callcenter is very noisy, people laughing in the background and the operators just follow a protocol and they all say the exact same things without properly understanding the issue.

They will do their best to keep your funds for as long as possible so they gain interest from them and you get stuck with them.

Overall very bad experience with them. and by the way, my funds haven't been transferred yet; it's been nearly 3 months of constant follow-ups",,,,,,1.0,
They are failing to attend to what was a simple enquiry about the fact they set up several accounts in my name and as a result spammed me inbox with automated queries. Rather than actually getting to the bottom of the matter the use attempts to resolve the issue to generate further meaningless correspondences rather actually communicate about the root issue. Totally useless customer services.,,,,,,1.0,
"[Company X] will happily take your money no questions asked but as from my recent experience where I have multiple pensions and they are not prepared to merge them without proof of who I am (Probably because I want to Transfer to another Pension provider!) They are being ultra difficult, I'll get to the bottom of this but the attitude of staff and the ponzy pension scheme is a scam. If it is difficult to transfer a pension now how difficult would they make it when I retire and request what's rightfully mine!",,,,,,1.0,
"Received a letter stating my account was insecure; advised to update details but unable to due to locked account.
Contacted customer service; they admitted restricting access but provided contradictory information, claiming it was fine while also investigating.
Promised communication within a week, but now taking multiple months and many calls causing significant stress and uncertainty.I still lack access to my account after over 2 months, leaving me worried and frustrated.
This experience felt unsafe and unprofessional, highlighting major internal issues at [Company X] Pension.
Would not recommend due to poor communication and unacceptable delays in resolving they own security actions.",,,,,,1.0,
"[Company X] charges high fees and makes it costly to transfer out your pension as you have to send them a bunch of paperwork and your ID by certified mail and pay for a notary to undersign everything, things other pension funds don't even ask for to complete an official transfer request from your preferred provider. Don't open an account as they will ignore you when you try to move your money out.",,,,,,1.0,
"This company is absolutely appalling! From start to finish I've had nothing but issues with them. I had for some reason 2 accounts and wanted them merged,when I called up about this the call handler was extremely rude and supervisor called to apologise having listened to the recorded conversation.
Then having turned retirement age I requested my paid in savings and waited for this to go into my bank account however I received an email telling me I had defered it another 10yrs!!!! Very frustrating and would certainly not recommend '[Company X]'.",,,,,,1.0,
"[Company X] Promised to contact me for the final time on the 13th of Feb to arrange payment of the lump sum they owe me. Ques what they failed as I have said before they are a Ponzi Scheme your money is at risk if you leave it with them. I do not believe they will ever pay my money
I have been chasing since the 29th Nov [PhoneNumber], I have talked to them for over 8 hrs numerous emails chat etc
Each time we get close to them paying out they find an excuse not to, there is always one more team that has to check
I disagree with nests response either they are a Ponzi scheme or they are grossly incompetent either way they should be close down to prevent them stealing more money from the government and hard working people
These are frauds and have no intention of ever paying out

"Please please please don't invest in this company,they will take your money via your work pension contributions each month and they have got a lovely web site showing you how much you have in your pension fund etc but trying to get it out is a absolute nightmare,I thought i would cash my small pension in when i reached 55 i started the ball rolling 3 Months before my 55th birthday and still a month later after my 55th birthday they are still dragging things out sending me form after form to fill in which i have done and sent them back at a cost to my self ive sent the same forms 4 times now and today was the final straw they said they needed another form signing. It took me 2weeks with arriva to get my money paid out brilliant service nest pension are absolutely disgusting they are supposed to be government backed the call centre is in India work it out ,put your money in somewhere else I be waiting for a response at the bottom of this complaint saying call the customer service number just watch.",,,,,,1.0,

Iâm asking for my own money because Iâm now terminal, and I have been treated so poorly , itâs also with the ombudsman because itâs no longer about the money , itâs because much deeper than that itâs about how they treat people like me and the lack of communication and professionalism I started to record all calls I made in end for evidence because you would never believe how bad it was if I didnât , itâs a shameful company ,",,,,,,1.0,
"I was enrolled through no fault of my own with the wrong date of birth.
Our HR department tried to fix this, but they couldn't.
I needed to send in a drivers licence or passport, but I need these documents all the time.
I sent in my srill in date, but old passport, but they sent it back because it had the corner cut off. Despite it having visas and all my details clearly visible. This is just being super pedantic and causing me no end of stress.

I have no other way of correcting the date of birth details, and I will be 97 before I can draw on my pension.

I trier opting out, and filled in the online form, and when I completed that, and hit submit, I was sent back to the homepage, so I have no idea what's going on now.

My company have signed up with another pension fund, and I am enrolling with that one and having my [Company X] contributions moved to the new provider.

It's the only way I can get to the funds and withdraw anything before I get to the age of 97. I am due to retire in 3 years.",,,,,,1.0,
"[Company X] has made a mistake with my title which I have requested it be changed several times. To date it is still showing me as Mrs when I am Miss.

"Ridiculously long time to access my pension funds (and still waiting). Requested cash in on 7th January, just had a live chat which has revealed that my ID still hasn't been verified, 16 WORKING days later (were told at one point to expect the money within 5-10 working days). ID was submitted via email on day 1 of the process. Raised a complaint and the information says that they will respond to the complaint within 20 working days. Extremely frustrating. I note looking at the other reviews that the positive comments are regarding transferring money INTO [Company X] - dig a little deeper and the significant amount of negative reviews are from customers trying to withdraw their funds. The same response is given each time, ie. stricter verification. This is nonsense, haven't had this issue with other providers. Beware.

Edit [PhoneNumber]: Still no further forward. After MANY phone calls it's becoming increasingly apparent that the [Company X] call centre is based overseas - probably India?* Each time we're trying to talk to operators who have difficulties understanding what we're saying and vice versa. Even voicemail messages are impossible to decipher. This is especially distressing/frustrating as my husband has a hearing disability (as do may customers of retirement age...).

* A little internet research indeed shows that the government has indeed outsourced [Company X] technical operations to Tata Consultancy Services, India.",,,,,,1.0,

I requested to transfer my [Company X] account to my NHS pension in April , this took so long that in August I decided to close the account and withdraw the money.
Iâve sent multiple documents to [Company X], some requested several times.
I was told that the only document they needed was my marriage certificate. That was sent 10 days ago.
This morning I have received a registered letter stating that I have requested to close my account because Iâve got a terminal illness and have less than 12 months to live so needed to fill out more documents.
This letter does not apply to me and Iâm appalled and upset that someone from [Company X] feels that itâs acceptable to send out such a letter .
Response to the message from [Company X]

My letter of complaint has already been submitted
I have provided more evidence than requested to give [Company X] the information needed over 14 days ago but no update
received.
So the problems continue
30/1/24 phone call today stating that all of the evidence requested and sent is not going to allow the funds to be transferred into my bank account. Months wasted , I now need to open a new bank account to get the pension fund transferred .
The person who rang was very difficult to understand, seems like the call was coming from outside of the UK
[PhoneNumber] Iâve called [Company X] pensions again today. I have now been asked for additional information even though they have the details of my account for the money to be paid into.
The person I spoke to today kept asking the same questions , for which I had already given her the answer. I asked if the information they are requesting today will be the last document of evidence they need, she did not know the answer. Apparently the staff in the back office are the only people who could answer this and they donât take calls.
I asked to speak to the complaints team, they donât work Saturdays .
Again it was evident that the person I spoke to was not in the UK

Before anyone from the business comment on this, check your logs.

Stop stealing from people. Build a system that doesnât fail on basics such as authentication.

Finally got it changed, logged in and did what I needed to do. Today I get an email asking me to log in because I have a message from [Company X], and guess what, the password which was correct last night is suddenly wrong tonight.
This was in connection with my wife's pension, but as an employer we also use [Company X] for our workplace pension. Not for much longer.

Utterly awful, and suggest you avoid them
The response below is nonsense as is [Company X], there should be a public inquiry into how [Company X] was set up and ask how the process was compliant under public sector rules and regulations, as GOV departments aren't allowed to just set something up with a competitive process! that's real law, [Company X] is nothing but a savings account run by non professionals forcing people into a ridiculous system and making it very hard to opt out. it's similar to the Post Office Scandal as there is no transparency on who they are, who gets paid for what or anything else. shocking!",,,,,,1.0,

People cannot send their passports and driving licences to random placesâ¦itâs not safe and we use them for work and travel.

"I've had the misfortune to be trying to withdraw a small pension from nest my experience is similar to most people on here.Customer service that take 10 to 20 days to respond to anything .When you do speak to someone they lie and obstruct and shift the goalposts,then send you a message asking for information they have had for years .
I was advised by Sarah in the UK to ignore the letter asking for more information as a code was being sent, She then advised me a senior manager would call me ,I was not in the least surprised they didn't.When I asked her for a direct contact number it seems nest in the UK do not give them,so when they don't keep their word there is no recourse ,its as though they have something to hide.
The stock response on here about the act in December [PhoneNumber] is untrue as well ,pension companies have always had to do due diligence.Another provider processed my pension wiith no hassles in 3 weeks in September last year .
[Company X] is owned by the government and in light of the post office scandal I'm amazed at how brazen their antics are.You can contact the office of the minister for work and pensions as technically he controls nest on [PhoneNumber], I'm sure his staff will not want this to becone another big issue.

But as soon as you start inquiring, or have multiple employers sending your pension to [Company X], or god forbid want to get your money transferred out into a different provider, their incompetence shines. I have had about 20 emails back and forth with them about two simple things: 1. Merge my accounts, if I have any; and 2. Transfer my pot out. They have sent me forms after forms asking me information that I do not have, I have given them everything I have, including my ID with name, DOB, address, national number, etc. How difficult can it be to confirm multiple IDs and merge them, and once done, transfer my account over? Argh - I have probably spent at least a few hours so far just doing a back and forth with them, I should start charging them for my time!!",,,,,,1.0,
"Continuing from my previous reviews - one extra star because something *actually happened*.

So I finally got fed up and sent a letter, Special Delivery, telling [Company X] that if they didn't send the verification code they promised in November, I'd take legal advice and raise my case with the Ombudsman. Lo and behold, today I get a letter (dated 13th *December*) stating that my bank details had not passed ""security check"". BS, because I'd sent them an original bank statement and they'd confirmed in writing.

So I call them, conversation as below;

Me: Hello, you've sent me a letter asking for different bank details.

Adviser: No, no we haven't.

Me: But I have it in front of me. And the confirmation in writing that you've received my bank statement.

Adviser: Oh - oh - no, we don't need new bank details. We've sent you another letter with a verification code, you'll receive it shortly. [Makes as if to end the call]

Me: (taking a punt) Would that be [reads code from the top of the letter in front of me]?

Adviser: Oh! Oh yes! That's the code!

Me: So, you *don't* need anything else from me in order to process my request?

Adviser: Er, no. I'll get someone from the Retirement Team to call you back soon.

[Call ends]

So - once bitten and all that - I'm sending a letter confirming what was said. I'll make one follow-up call next week if nobody calls me, then it's going to the Ombudsman with copies of all the correspondence and the phone logs.

EDIT: Sarah, thank you for your response. I don't want to make a complaint, I just want this sorted. My [BankDetail] [CompanyReference]; this should easily enable you to find out which of your advisers spoke to me on 12th January, and why there is apparently so much confusion.

I donât have my payout yet, itâs allegedly in some âback officeâ being validated.

There should be something in place for clients when a situation arises where the company do not fulfil their own promises. We should be able to charge interest every day after 5 working days of submitting our claim and requested documents.

I gave them the tracking number and suddenly there was a problem in the mailing room. It arrived back to me recorded delivery the following day. Then there was a problem with 2 separate accounts which my husband was told were merged back in July. Now they weren't. Then it was fixed and I was told the money would be with me within 3-5 working days. Guess what? It wasn't. I phoned them and the guy on the bereavement team hung up on me. I phoned back and was told it would now be 5-8 working days to get paid. I'm not holding my breath. It's now in the hands of my lawyer.,,,,,,1.0,

It can take [PhoneNumber] days!? Have you had the âletterâ!? Yes Iâve had the âletterâ and given you the code and been told it will now be 5 days!? Still nothing!

If you had you would see it is not fit for purpose, I have proved who I am, received mail to my address and confirmed the âcodeâ I am NOT a scumbag scammer just a pensioner trying to get MY money off you!

If you're with a company who uses [Company X] Pensions, take out your money immediately, as soon as you're paid. If you can request your company move it to somewhere else, I'd highly recommend finding your own pension company.

Refusing to hand over my money to transfer into another pension pot.

Firstly it's too much and they need signed documents from me - which they send via email. An online signature is not enough.

Took SEVEN months for them to send it out themselves in paper form.

Get to the bottom, and I find I also have to send them my passport now.

Well, not a chance am I doing that. I wouldn't trust them with a decaying leaf, let alone personal documents like that. And no, you can't send them a picture.

So, I go back and am told it's because I'm trying to transfer more than a certain amount.

So, I tell them to cancel the transfer. Takes about 4 months to get that sorted.

So, I try a smaller amount - just a measly Â£500.

Same problem, apparently you have to send them this information still.

Told them over and over to give me my money, to close my account - constant refusal and told to send them my written consent.

Sent about 6 emails this month alone telling them it's impossible for me to print off these documents.

Absolutely archaic practices. I can sign up for a new passport online with no issues. I can do a driver's license - also no issues. Getting a mortgage? Yup, I can do that over the phone or just online.

But a couple grand from a pension pot?

No. Not a chance.

Thank you for the reply
Unfortunately itâs still a 1 star

I received a email to log into the account just on Christmas Eve
It stated that I need to log into the account.
As I cannot access it I panicked fearing I lost thousands.
Today I phoned up and had a conversation about this
Now she explained that the account was closed down due to the fact am withdrawing my money early January.
What annoys me the fact is that this isnât stated anywhere and NOT IN THE EMAIL YOU SENT ME.
As I couldnât log in why send a email??? In the 1st place.
Now as this experience has left me unhappy what is going to happen??
I really find this disgusting that itâs happened yet Iâve to use my phone to be reassure that the email was right and I couldnât log in and to confirm my account was closed.
Why wasnât this put in the email why is it a secret???

"When I started with [Company X], I opted the Pre-retirement Fund. It all went well but then these ""geniuses"" decided to scrap that fund and automatically move my pot into the Retirement Date Fund. And guess what? Of course, they lost 20% of my pot money in that markets crash under Liz Truss. It's because the lads running [Company X] simply don't care. Why would they? They simply cynically charge 3% off every contribution and this doesn't depend on how irresponsibly they gamble at the markets with my pension money. Now I have moved what has left of my pension pot's money into the Lower Growth Fund. Yet I'm afraid that these ""geniuses"" will scrap this fund too and will again move my pension money into a gambling at the markets fund ""for my own good"" - because they don't care. Why would they?",,,,,,1.0,

"I'm enrolled in [Company X] because my employer chose it. The site is very basic, not all that user-friendly and there is almost nothing by way of analytics or information pertaining to pension performance etc. They email once a year with a summary. Overall with contributions of over Â£19.2k since [PhoneNumber] my pot is worth....Â£20k - a whopping Â£800 growth. Not exactly stellar.

[Company X] are also only just starting to implement 2FA, however it is the weakest form which uses SMS messages; I would prefer to have the option to use a proper authenticator app for example.

When it comes to beneficiaries, [Company X] don't offer the option to add even basic contact details for beneficiaries such as email address and mobile number (which are now, let's be frank, pretty much permanent throughout someone's life). You can only add an address and it could be all-too-easy to forget to update this, especially if a beneficiary is renting and has to move home more than a homeowner would.

I wouldn't use [Company X] if I didn't have to - I'm only in it because I want the (meagre) contribution from my employer which is better than nothing. As my earnings are increasing it's reaching the point where I will need to pay more into my pension in order to avoid losing my tax-free allowance and falling into the so-called '60% tax trap' - I won't use [Company X] for this, I will be setting up my own personal pension (probably with a company like AJ Bell).

I suspect a lot of employees find themselves with a load of money tied up in a [Company X] pension that isn't really growing and will probably want or need to do something for themselves elsewhere to have any meaningful pension pot when retirement arrives.

Ironically the only reason I'm writing this is because [Company X] emailed me asking for a review and it made me think about how poor the performance has been and how basic/insecure the site is.",,,,,,1.0,

[Company X] pensions then began to take monthly payments this happened for two months then stopped for no apparent reason so I contacted nest pensions to request my two months contributions back Which I was informed it's not possible until I'm 55. The point I would like to make is for one I didn't opt in to nest pensions and secondly I didn't opt out but now I'm Â£288 out of pocket through no fault of my own.

"Subpar service.

Nearly 3 months and my pension pot has still not been transferred out from [Company X]. Origo is supposed to make this process slick and efficient and indeed when transferring from Royal London the same process took 10 days so I know speedier transfers are possible.

I was forced into using [Company X] for a period but always begrudged the high 1.8% contribution fee.

I have had 14 emails and calls to [Company X] I repeatedly ask to transfer my money to another provider. They still say ([PhoneNumber]) it can't be moved unless I provide ID documentation. They then repeatedly acknowledge they received all appropriate documentation at the start of Oct 23. It is now 20days since they acknowledged my complaint and I have not had a resolution. I will now report to financial ombudsman and the pension regulator in the hope of getting out of this nightmare loop.

To be honest I have not got a clue. Is it a good pension as for experience I donât have one. I retired from the NHS pension scheme with mental health officer status.

Upon trying to resolve my issues with customer service, I'm always speaking to non-native English speakers who seem to have no idea what I'm asking for or about. I had to reword a simple question THREE TIMES only for one agent to reply with 'can you ring us' and didn't even include the number. It is actually comical how bad the service is. I'm currently speaking to an agent to try and get some info about how to leave and never return, and - as expected - it is like getting blood from a stone. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.

I have a [Company X] pension started by my employer just over 2 years ago,
I went online to look at it, which was easy enough, to find out there were 3 names and addresses listed and registered to the POT ID I had been given. This meant that when I went on I could see very personal information from other investor, such as NI number, address, dates of birth, their contributions employer details the lot. they tried to blame my employer for the error, however it isn't my employer that allocate funds to a pot it is nest, so they must have given the contributions to it from payments made from my salary, NOT THE EMPLOYER. i have been sent a statement of payments made and looking at my payslips some are missing and the record isnt complete. for me this has caused me serious stress and anxiety as if i can see their information they would have been able to see mine. Breach of confidentiality etc.
I have heard from them today after toing and froing for over 5 months to say hopefully they have sorted the issue and I should be able to access my POT under a new reference number soon. How soon I wonder? they have offered me just under Â£350 compensation for the time spent dealing with it, and telephone calls etc. nothing for ll the sleepless nights I have had and cost of medication to try to keep me calm and reduce anxiety about others having access to my information.
If I had a choice , i would never invest iwth [Company X], and indeed I will be transferring my funds all by a pound every couple of months to another pension provider that I have. I got letters saying I could log into my account and access online from people I could not even speak to. what a waste of money for postage when the content was not valid. and was allocated a complaints handler who could never tell me anything.

"What a horrendous pension provider, transferring to a different provider has, so far, taken 6 weeks, they already have very bad reputation for not letting peopleâs money go easily and can now see why, theyâve put me and the receiving pension provider through the ringer, requesting duplicate forms being signed and sent recorded with passports and IDs, back and forward constantly requesting confirmation, secure messages, phone calls. Worst nightmare Iâve ever encountered to get my own pension transferred some place else.

Meanwhile, the people in the customer service struggle with the language and donât understand.

Also, a 4% has been lost in value since I requested my transfer, and starting to think it has something to do with them making it difficult for things to move forward.

Looks like [Company X] have a dark past too, with Â£1million missing back in [PhoneNumber] as result of fraud, so alarm bells ringing loud.

Not at all recommended, you have been warned.

Edit to address the lies on the reply from [Company X] Pension: was asked to send the same signed form three times, one in electronic format, a signed form in the post and again the same signed form but this time enclosing my driving license. This process is not in the regulations as this wasnât my first transfer in [PhoneNumber] and the above overload of information, documents and ID was never requested.

[Company X] make you jump through hoops and ask you to complete a pension transfer questionnaire, which in itself is not a problem, but some of the questions are irrelevant. [Company X] then ask for the form to be accompanied by ID which has to be verified (we paid the Post Office for this service) and posted to them, which we duly did recorded delivery. They then send another message through the [Company X] mail portal saying they need more information (they won't say what though) because, I can only presume, that allows them to delay the process and hold onto your pension pot. They will never reply to your messages through their mail portal and when calling them, expect a loooong delay. Oh, and to cap it all, forget the live chat, they're about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike and follow a written text process. However, they have an incredible ability of completely removing any human emotions and customer / service experience. I've dealt with many companies throughout my personal and business life and [Company X] is right up there as one of the worst.. If it wasn't for a gentleman called John who was as helpful as he could be and has attempted to resolve the issue by requesting a call back from the Transfer Team (which I'm now waiting for) they would have got 1 star... Let's see where this goes but frustratingly it could end up with a complaint to the ombudsman which I'd rather avoid as I just want the pension pot transferred..

Thank you Abbie. An official complaint has now been raised with [Company X] as the information I was told was missing on my first call to [Company X] completely differed to the information I was told was missing on my second call. In addition, I completely understand the 'compliance' on this transfer to prevent scams. However, I'm disappointed that [Company X] use this 'to their advantage' when in my instance, I am transferring my pension to another FCA approved pension provider via an FCA approved advisor. There is clearly no scam element in this transfer. Awful service by [Company X] and I stand by my assumption that [Company X] make this transferring out intentionally difficult for their customers and ultimately for [Company X]'S financial gain..",,,,,,1.0,

"It is very common to have more than one Private Pension Company, we change jobs and the new company we start working for has a different private pension company they deal with so we end up putting our money into at least 2-3 different companies. If we want a bit more value for our money best to put it all in one basket and that's what I chose to do: I moved my pension money from one company to another one and chose [Company X] over the other option I had. You really do not need a Financial Advisor to do that: [Company X] makes it so easy for you and as long as you have an online account with them it really takes 5 minutes to do! No money was taken from one side or the other to actually do the transfer and [Company X] took care of the bureaucratic side of the move.

"Please beware. Especially if you are approaching retirement age. I recently had my 55th birthday and decided to take all of my [Company X] Pension pot out as I already have an occupational pension.
I contacted [Company X] a month previously and told them I was buying a house and would need to know when the funds were available. I was told to allow 5 working days from account closure. On my birthday I closed my account. I uploaded the necessary documents and I verified my bank account through their automated service. They displayed the value of my pot but this was from the previous day. My expectation was that the potâs value would be its value of the day I closed the account. Best always publish values from close of business on the day.
I did not receive any communications from them and yesterday, 4th October I received a letter to say they had issued funds and it would be in my bank account within 5 working days. The letter is dated 28th September. They also said the value of my pot had gone down over Â£[PhoneNumber] since I closed and as such I would be receiving a reduced amount.
I called to complain and was told that I should receive the money by 9th October and that it should have been the full value of my pot on the day I actioned the closure as the funds should have been crystallised at that point. So they are looking into it.
But currently I have lost Â£[PhoneNumber] of my investment and one full month investment on a large sum of money. In 21st century it cannot be right to take 28 days to withdraw your own money from a savings pot with the risk of it depreciating in the meantime.",,,,,,1.0,

6 times I had requested their email to be sent via post as I donât own a printer and they need a signed form returning with the ID they requested.

First form I returned with requested ID never showed up or lost, ok possibly a Royal Mail fault.

Second time sent Royal Mail signed for â¦.. that showed up ok.

Iâve now had another email, requesting proof of address!!!! Why wasnât this asked for with the original email that only asked photo ID..?

Maybe to waste time eh!

I have seen over Â£500 drop from my pension since the original request to move it.

If anyone is reading this at the start of trying to transfer money out, send proof of address with your photo ID. Hopefully it will save you weeks, postage costs, 30 minutes at a time on hold i. phone calls as well as losing the will to live!

EDIT:- as I donât pay any utilities at the the property I live at, ( all in my partnerâs name) Iâve had to buy an house, update my address and pay some utilities to get my moneyâ¦. Wish this was a joke!

Firstly they declined to transfer the money without an official letter head from NHS pension, forwarded one immediately. Then they claimed they couldnât go ahead because I was still paying into [Company X]. No payments had been made since April!
Now, today they have informed me that they have their own transfer out pack that I must request from them. This needs to be sent to NHS pensions and then returned to them.
In the six months since first requesting the transfer and the completion of the NHS pack by my employer and [Company X], the [Company X] transfer request pack has never been mentioned.

I really donât understand why companies have to enroll you in this kind of PRIVATE pensions if you donât ask. They just enroll you and get the money from your payslip. Opting out is a loooong and complicated procedure and what is worst is that after one year of opting out you are authomatically re-enrolled into this pension and you find out only reading your miserable payslip.

This crazy interface impossible to use if you are no some ""certified accountant"" who has used to Excel and computers with floppy disks. If you forgot to exchange USD to GBP in time and Direct Debit to collect payments failed they will never repeat attempt again. You will have to go and setup everything a new. And there is no way to setup without 40m of chatting with support agent, because there is no straight way to do this. You have to do some hack like go there, click here, switch to card payment, enter 0, then go there and so on and so on. Then you'll wait for week+ while they will setup Direct Debit and make it working. Looks like they do this manually still. If you have some contributions overdue, there is no way to fix it youself - all buttons are greyed out and blocked, no any single feature works. And so on.

"Transferring in a previous pension supplier to [Company X] was extremely fast and hassle free, took about a week

Put in a request to transfer out of [Company X] and I'm now over a month waiting. Started the transfer, 8/9 working days later [Company X] acknowledge the request, Any message you send via the portal takes 8-10 working days for a response, [Company X] requested certain ID and forms to be printed and sent to an address. I queried why they needed to be sent to an address when they accepted ID through the messaging system previously. 9 working days later they confirm they can be sent via the messaging system (Why not include that in the original request). Sent off everything via the messaging system as requested.

The company I'm transferring too start asking if I'm still transferring as they hadn't heard anything and I have till the 19th Sep or they will cancel the transfer.

Today 8 working days later, I recieve an email stating I have a message to read on the messaging system as usual. Attempt to log in with my finger print, says my details are wrong. I check my username and password, both are correct, still can't log in. I attempt the password reminder, type in my username and it says its been deleted. I have no access to the messaging system. I check my new pension provider my money isn't there. My [Company X] account doesn't exist. Did they transfer it and its not showed up yet? I have no clue as I can't log in to read whatever message has been sent.

If I ever go to change employer, one of my first questions on the interview will be who is your pension provider, if it's [Company X] I'll terminate the interview. I do not need this level of delay or incompetence remotely near any of my money saved for the future. This is one of those companies that appear to run smooth until you actually need to interact with them.

Edit, due to reply: Response below has no bearing on anything I've written. I did not mention the simplicity of anything. The constant 9/10 working day responses for messages are the one of the issues, There is no regulation that came into force that stated every reply needed to be dragged out over such a period. Another issue of closing my account whilst at the same time sending me emails directing
me to messages on the portal that I can no longer access is the other. Also not telling me the account was closed (Let me guess that's what the portal message I can't access says?) I have a deleted [Company X] account, No funds showing on my new pension provider and no communication from [Company X] as to what they have done or if the transfer is a success.

Regulations stating ID requirements etc I understand but they didn't need posting and that was the only option given via the portal message system until queried.

I rang to clear this up, 1st CS agent told me I'd simply not activated my account and never used it. I explained I had and have been communicating with [Company X] via it. They said it wasn't possible as I'd never activated the account. So I tried, Not possible, account does not exist. Rang back again explained and the CS agent told me I haven't activated my account, kept them on the phone whilst I entered all my details on the activation page (I had already confirmed them for the phone call) and yet again wouldn't work. After 10 minutes of this it turns out.. it's because they closed my account because the transfer had gone through. Did that information just pop up infront of them after 2 phone calls and wasting my time trying to activate an account for nothing?

Just incompetence on every level and your generic response not acknowledging any of my key points just goes to highlight it even more. Well done.",,,,,,1.0,

"[Company X] Pensions, have to be the worst organisation, Ive ever had to deal with in my life. Unprofessional, unethical from the start, they have the worst communication skills, known to man. I have spoken to 14 separate members of staff in 3 days, each one has their own version of information they pass on, some of the Customer Services team have been rude and abrupt, when one person tells you to stop talking and listen, I find that, unacceptable, your calls gets cut off, midway talking through what the background of the case is, not sure if this is due to, many of the team are working from home, 3 times this has happened. I am still no further forward than I was on the initial conversation on the 3rd Aug [PhoneNumber], where I wanted to take a small amount out of the pot. Speaking to the Advisor, who, talked me through the whole process on the phone, could see that the request had been done, said nothing. I even got a email informing me that the request had gone to Experian. No more communications, until I made the call 21st Aug [PhoneNumber] to find out when the money was due to be placed in the bank .It appears that I have 4 accounts, unbeknown to me, as employers, have registers my details, with my name spelt wrong, wrong DOB & NI number, you couldn't write, it honestly. Therefore with no communications they cancelled the request. They don't seem to understand the urgency. God forbid you want to speak to a supervisor or manager, they say we'll get someone to call you back, still waiting for that to happen. Its a sad day when you have to take your mobile phone to the loo, just in case they call, 3 days on and nobody has had the decency, to return my call. Why they couldn't process the initial request, then merge the accounts together, I have know idea. I have sent them every photo ID I have, marriage cert, Birth certs as well, each one I'm told takes 10 days to process, a letter of Authorisation has been sent, again, still not activated, another 10 days, on top of the 10 days for each other document I sent, set up a Delegates account, still my wife can't speak to them. A catalogue of errors . a complete cluster ! that I have no control over what so ever. Its my money, I'm entitled to, but for other peoples incompetence, can't get it.

I have emailed and called repeatedly to be told each time I need to provide the ""[BankDetail] [BankDetail] a valid UK bank account"".

In response to their response I trust them less and less. It's not protective nor about following procedures. Forms returned get lost.

Cash waiting to be invested: Â£xxxx

"Initially I wanted to speak to someone about the transfer of money from my Peoples Pension to [Company X]. Spent 15mins on the phone with no answer.

Peoples Pension had my name on the account as my first and middle name which didn't include my surname. I rang the Peoples Pension and they said it was easy for someone from [Company X] to call them and clarify that it was still the same account. Next I left another email saying why there had been a problem. The reply mentioned about me changing my name and I needed to provide [Company X] with this proof. I hadn't changed my name, and said reiterated it in an email and that it only needed someone from [Company X] to contact from the other pension company.

"I'm not so sure if these guys got so big, that they just don't invest in their organic bureaucratic system, and they transpire like a scam to the general public, the system is the mirror of the reflex of their management, namely that service manager RICHARD HARDY, an incompetence beyond belief, they are so much at loss, that they went into complexity instead of simplifying things for the customers, the disappointment is so huge that i find it useless to talk to them, they just don't listen to their own mistakes, they create the problems like open up accounts for same users already enrolled, and the stupidity is so big that they don't realise what they doing.
In the end to make matters worse they insist that the customer has to prove is identity, when they did the mistakes in the first place.
Stay out of this company if you can, they already have nearly 12 billion pounds lost in their system, that no one reclaims, it's all about money, they don't care with the customer, but i'm gonna take to the court and ask a huge compensation for their incompetence and expose their scam.",,,,,,1.0,

"Absolutely dreadful company to deal with. I contacted them around the middle of June to close my account and request that the money they had taken from me be refunded into my bank account. I spent around 20 minutes on the phone to one of their operatives going through all the details. He advised me that my account would not be closed there and then because there was another deduction due from my wage on 27th of June. He informed me that my account would automatically be closed after that date, and that my refund would be in my account within four working days, and there was nothing else I needed to do.

Needles to say, this did not happen. 18th of July and still no sign of my money being refunded. So I phoned [Company X] today and spoke with one of their operators called Chris. He was unable to give me any clear information on why my money has not been refunded, informed me that I had two accounts with [Company X] (despite me only having one employer, and despite me not being able to log on to my account because the previous operator cancelled it). Several times he told that he wasn't sure why my account was closed and yet on their system they still have two accounts for me, and could only give me the vague reassurance that once it (what ever it is supposed to be) is sorted out, my money should be in my bank account within 5 to 12 working days. No time frame given as to when the problem would be sorted.

This is not acceptable. I have requested to speak to someone more senior to discuss my concerns, and have been informed that I will receive a call back from someone within the next four hours. I am not holding my breath.

They consistently use the same tricks to keep hold of your hard earned cash, which they proceed to ""invest"" in their ongoing vanity projects.

Probably because they realise if we could actually choose where we wanted to invest our funds, it wouldn't be with [Company X].",,,,,,1.0,
"It has been very difficult to access my pension pot. They claim it takes two weeks to receive the payout but itâs now been well over a month and they still havenât paid. When I contact support they claim to have limited information on the status. They just constantly come up with new requests for additional information - what seem like blatant ploys to delay paying me the money they have taken from me over the years - atrocious! I will keep you updated on progress.

UPDATE Itâs now taken another 11 days. They sent me a letter with a code that I have to read to them over the phone. But when I call them to do that, customer service says they are not trained to take the code and a special department has to take it. But they canât put me through to that department and I canât call that department, they have to call me! They promised that department would call same or next day but that didnât happen of course. And so it goes on!!!

At last I got to speak to the department that can take the code from me over the phone, which they did. Then they told me they now pass the request on to another department who will hopefully 'pick it up' within a few days. Then within another few days that department will set a payment date sometime in the future (no guarantee when). Then once the payment date is set it should take 5 days (from then payment date) for them to send me my money.

So basically still no fixed timescale because they have to set payment date which is floating. An unbelievable process that is obviously designed to delay the payment of money back to contributors, while hiding behind the excuse of security!

If you need to take money ,out of your pension pot, in a couple of years time I suggest you start the process now!

Itâs now another two weeks and still no progress. Despite promising to set a payment date they have not done it. When ever I call the retirement team they are not available to answer any questions. It just goes on and on. Avoid this company like the plague!",,,,,,1.0,

"I asked [Company X] in March to transfer a portion of a pension from my other small pension closed book scheme (PW), to enable me to close that one under the Small Pot rules.
[Company X] erroneously requested the whole amount, which they received in April. NOT what they were instructed, which they have admitted. After trying for a few weeks to find out what was happening and getting nowhere including patently wrong information from one of their alledged pension advisors. I registered a formal complaint and have now had the same holding letter 3 times.

On calling and actually speaking to someone in complaints, it turns out PW had told them in mid May they couldn't receive the money back, and they had only done what [Company X] had asked via the Origo system.

So I'm now stuck as Ican't cash out [Company X] because its over the Small Pot limit, and i dont want to trrigger the reduced MPAA limit, which is what i was initially trying to achieve.
[Company X] complaints say the issue has been escalated to a senior team, well according to the last update date, that was on 23rd May.. ive had to do all the chasing to fInd out anything. At no stage have I had an explanation email or apology for their slipshod handling of MY money, which I need them to resolve ASAP. How this is supposed to inspire confidence in them, God knows.

Well clearly that 3rd July response is automated nonsense. I HAVE been in touch with complaints as my initial review states. And in my latest contact with them lastvweek, the same bloke I spoke to 2 weeks previously clearly hadn't done anything...said that 'by coincidence' they were Emailing PW today to see if they could refund the money to them.... already been told twice that they can't..

"Great for putting money in, but they didn't increase my pension pot so not very good at investments.

I have spent days trying to prove who I am and my address as I send a document and have to wait to see if it is approved. Then they decide that they need more documents and wait a few more days. They were quick enough to take my money, shouldn't they have done all this then? I am trying to buy an Annuity and the process has timed out once already.

"Update: 15th June [PhoneNumber]

I have now contacted the press (a well known consumer investigation programme and asked them to investigate [Company X] as I have still had no response from [Company X] to letters, complaints or to help resolve the issue). They clearly do not care.

Abbie, if you are so concerned about my experience why donât you arrange to call me or get a senior manager to call me to sort this mess out! Better still Iâd be happy to talk to Richard Hardy Head of Ops or Helen Dean the CEO to tell them my experience and a few home truths about Tata and [Company X]. First of all I will contact the PRA as Iâm sure they would love to hear all these issues people are having.
You are playing with peoples retirement funds here who have worked hard yet are unable to get anywhere with your organisation!

So it appears [Company X] use Tata consultancy to administer members accounts, no wonder there are so many problems! They stick to their scripts and donât actually want to help you if it falls outside of their script.

They have not acknowledged my complaints or provided a reference within 5 days which they say they will do. But it seems they are untouchable and you might as well kiss goodbye to any money you have with them. You send them form after form and they say they havenât received it or you need to provide this and that. AVOID AND OPT OUT THEN GO TO A BETTER PROVIDER!

Yet another conversation with [Company X] today and still they are as useless and incompetent as ever!!! They deal with messages 2 weeks after they are sent but things have moved on and they donât bother to read the whole case so ask me for things that have been superceded by other messages and conversations. I have lost the will to live with [Company X]. I know that when it comes to withdrawing the money they will do everything to prevent me from doing so. I have written to Helen Dean the CEO outlining the issues with the organisation she responsible for.
[Company X] do not follow Treating Customers Fairly or Good customer outcomes. If they are regulated by the FCA that is my next complaint to them.

As I canât reply to your response Abbi, I will update here. Your typical response is laughable as I have contacted your customer services on numerous occasions previously by phone and message and still Iâm no further forward.


Absolute shambles of a company. Have wasted weeks trying to deal with [Company X] and their admin is terrible. Iâm now trying to transfer my funds to another provider who have said [Company X] told them I am still contributing so they wonât transfer the funds. How can I still be contributing when I cancelled the direct debit? I am tearing my hair out at their incompetence. This is what happens when a company is backed by the government.

If you want to spend hours trying to resolve problems and raise complaints that arenât dealt with or acknowledged then by all means invest.

If they canât deal with simple admin tasks what will they be like when you want to draw down the pension?

Itâs almost like they deliberately try to make things difficult!

I would like to discuss this with a senior manager or someone that actually knows what they are doing. I will see what happens when I call them on Monday but I know it will be another waste of my time and effort!
As soon as I am able I will transfer out of [Company X] to another provider. One that isnât backed by the government which is why [Company X] are so bad.",,,,,,1.0,

Now because of their automated system, my company has been reported to the pension regulator for an outstanding contribution and a former employee has been told that their pension has not been paid by my company which does not explain that the whole reason for this is [Company X]'s complete incompetence as a company.

If I didnât chase them, nothing would get done
They asked for the bank details to pay my money into. I had to send a PDF. Because NatWest call my account a foundation account, [Company X] wonât pay me as this is a charity or business account!! How ridiculous. So I spend an hour of my day rectifying this so they accept my bank account.

3 hours later I get a call from them asking me about my account being a charity or a business.
You can imagine my response

Apparently you also canât make a complaint either because it gets ignored and there is no complaints department according to a contact centre advisor.

Contact centre are all reading off a script and are absolutely zero help.

I have requested a dead lock letter so I can go to the FCA and an ombudsman which Iâve been refused because apparently they donât issue them.

Fantastic pension provider. Nice and simple to use. You can view your total pension pot and splits it into your contributions and employers contributions so you can see how much has been put in from you and them.

1.

I managed to do this all on line and was advised to keep it in another month due to another payment going in.
When the money was due to be paid into my bank nothing appeared,so I gave them a phone call and was told I had gone over a threshold and the account had been flagged 6 days before I rang with a note saying I should be contacted,which I wasn't.

They have given me no proper explanation about why this has happened and I now only have 2 weeks to pay off my mortgage.

"I attempted to transfer a third pension into [Company X]. It was from a final salary scheme . The attempt was unsuccessful , as something in the system was not comparable . Fair enough .
But I was not notified in any way , so it was several months before it came to my attention .
I also find , while very pleasant , the people employed in the call centres do not understand the nuances and dialects of the English language . In the same vein , it is very difficult to understand their accents . I presume that is because they are in a different country .

They require you to complete a form sent by post within 5 working days in order to update your d.o.b, or I.D. to be sent over email. But it must be attached as a password protected file, with the password then typed into the email - completely defying the point of having a password at all.

This is not a modern or effective security measure, like 2 point verification (which they use for other things, but not this). They are clearly using an antiquated system and useless customer service advisors in order to fraudulently hold on to employee's funds.

"It's the pension pot from the government but any ulterior economic body should do something with it. I have got 4 different pension pots and some knowledge in finance. This pension pot is nothing but a scam. It is losing money from the very 1st. day. They don't update your contributions until 4 weeks later, so they are probably playing with out own money for their benefit. They don't give you information about where they invest. They told me they decide depending on my age so I cannot even decide where I want to put my money (less or higher risk). So 0 transparency. It is an absolute rubbish that someone should do something. It is a real public scam that should be closed. Employers please, if you really care about you your employees and their future don't even consider this fund.

"I have been trying to transfer my pension from [Company X] into another accredited workplace scheme. 4 months on and I am still being fobbed off by [Company X], constantly asking for more and more information. So far I have sent 2 copies of the same form completing ALL information for the new ACCREDITED scheme. I have then been amber/red flagged and referred to the Money Helper people (of which there is a month wait to have the 1 hour call). I managed to get a cancellation and after just 15 minutes they were staggered I had been referred to them as I was switching from one Master Trust to another.
I was advised by a Manager in their Bombay call centre that once I emailed my reference number from the phone call with the Money Helper people that my money would finally be released!

As you can imagine this has NOT been the case and on the very last day of responding to my complaint lodged well over a month ago they finally responded on the deadline date to ask me for the following:

Before we can process your request, we need the following document evidences listed here, in order to ensure you are protected against fraudulent activity.

A letter from your employer confirming that

â¢ they are a sponsoring employer of your new scheme

â¢ you are employed by them

â¢ the date from when youâve been continuously in their employment and

â¢ confirmation of contributions to your pension scheme which are shown as due to be paid by your employer and the dates of
those payments

A schedule of contributions or payment schedule showing

â¢ separate entries of the amounts of pension contributions to your pension scheme that were due to be paid for the last 3
months of your employment along with the dates (excluding your additional voluntary contributions)

â¢ payslips, or other evidence in writing advising of pay remittances, showing the salary paid to you by your employer for the
last 3 months

â¢ personal bank or a building society statements, showing the deposit of earnings for the last 3 months

Once we receive these details from you, weâll validate the request and proceed with the request.

Again a lengthy call with the Bombay call centre to be told this was indeed a mistake and as I had supplied ALL evidence, jumped through several hoops, grown a unicorn and flown to the moon this extra information was NOT needed and the money should have been released by now.

As it stands [Company X] still have my money, I have raised a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman and have warned others about putting money into this scheme. In the 2 years I have been forced to use them, I have made to date Â£19 from whatever low risk investments they dabble in.

It is NOT worth the hassle and risk to lose your money with this company. If anyone is a scam or fraudulent this is [Company X] at the top of the list, they will hang on to your money and will REFUSE to release it no matter how much documentation, evidence or phone-calls you make.

They advised that I must send photo ID to confirm my DoB, stating they need the photo to check it's me (not sure how that is possible being that I'm doing it over email).
Finally, after an hour-long call with them, they mentioned they can take a birth certificate - which contradicts what they said about photo ID. Bizarre double standards for the rules at [Company X], for something that would only take the small amount of common sense to see and resolve.
Weird side note, the advisor told me if I wanted to change my name then I can do that without having to send any ID at all, which seems a lot more dangerous in my opinion.",,,,,,1.0,

I then paid in some money and again there was quite a bit of delay in making the investment.
While I was able to chose my risk level and enough information was available to help with this decision I still feel it lacks clarity what is 'inside' the risk level.
Overall, after half a year, I am happy and only a longer term view can establish if this is a 'more profitable than average' investment however, it doesn't feel 'slick' or smooth right now.",,,,,,1.0,

I have written at trustpilot a review before, where [Company X] has replied, saying they need to make sure the money goes to the right person and including their telephone number. Calling this number, is quite useless as they tell me, they can not tell me where the problem is and they also can not forward me to a designated department to get this issue solved. They only can listen to my complaints. Some weeks ago I had a phone call from [Company X] where they told me, they experience some technical issues and have quite a few people, because of these technical issues, they can not pay out their money. [Company X] has since September [PhoneNumber] on my behalf all document they need. It is almost December [PhoneNumber] and I still havenât been payed out my money. Not being able to talk to the right people who can explain in depth what is going on and when I will receive my money, Iâm waiting now for more than two months and still no sign when they will pay out my money.

[Company X] today [PhoneNumber] has replied to the above comment just suggesting to call the exact number, which I have experience is useless as they only are able to tell me, things are in the process but are not able to give informations or where in the process I am. Choosing to opt out and sending in all needed documents, started in September [PhoneNumber]. In their policy it says, it takes 5-10 days. Now it is 18.

"I had a small nest pension that o wanted to withdraw on my 55 birthday. I did all the paper work for the withdrawal a month in advance and called them to ensure all was well . They told me everything was ok and I would be told when the money would be released. I had to ring them four or five times to ask them what was going on and why it was taking so long . Each time I was assured that it was going through . Eventually neatly ten days later than I was told , the money was put into my bank account . Talk about dragging their heels and telling you what you want to hear and then still not acting very quickly . Very frustrating as I was totally in their hands.",,,,,,1.0,

"Terrible service. easy to put money in. But you try to get it out. Even you are eligible to do so.

It's been over 2 months and I still have not got my money out.
First they don't trust my bank account. Then they want passport
I learned that some of the problem was that the employer spelled my name wrong.
They don't accept email and take 2 weeks to reply so its easy to miss the fact they have found a way ot to send my money. Its managed by one of those foreign call centers that's has a way different culture so its impossible to get at the people responsible.

What other type make it easy to pay in but hard to pay out?

"At 55 I decided to cash in. At first it all went ok. had to call again as pack did not arrive.. a 40 min call to Indian call centre got a new pack sent out plus via email. Then the game began,, Heard nothing so called. They had requested a scan of bank statement. Sent it off then had a letter weeks later to say it did not pass security checks called again.. found out they had inputted the wrong bank acount number as their staff had put the last number in . wrong. I clarified the correct number and was assured they now had the right number. a few days later had a text to say that payment would be made. Waited 6 days and nothing in bank. Called again and found that they had not put they correct bank info.. was told I would be called back. nothing no call..
Called again they still had the wrong details.
Asked to speak to a UK [Company X] Manager.. on hold for over 40 mins finally..but no was told I would get a call back. No call came. Have passed whole issue to solicitor to sue nest. DO NOT USE THEM. You will not get your pension. They owe me 10,000 and it looks like I wont be seing my cash untill I win a court case against them.

worst company I have ever had dealings with, DO NOT USE



After around 3 months they replied to this review. Surprise surprise the same standard auto reply the put on every bad review they get.. no personal case relevant help.. just the number for their god awful customer service team who don't have a clue.

I did finally get the money 2 months late and after nearly 30 calls to chase and clear matters. Then this week I get a letter from them to apologise for there cockups .. offering me Â£75 Compensation. Have written back to tell them that I do not accept that amount. Have given 5 days to give a higher offer if not then small claims court here I come.

AGAIN DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY EVER. THE WORST.",,,,,,1.0,

Further to the response from Customer Service: I continue to have major issues with [Company X] incompetence. In the last 7 days I have received 3 phone calls each repeating the same mantra about our account. We have provided the information and most recently today (3rd phone call in 5 days saying they don't have the required information) when we now find out, surprise surprise, our payment is not forthcoming. I cannot recommend strongly enough that users should exit [Company X] as soon as possible or face the consequences.",,,,,,1.0,
"Iâm gonna transfer my pension into a SIPP account, at least i have the choice to invest my money in something that i want instead of letting them using my funds, because everytime i get some, after a while is getting down a lot.
I donât understand this type of pension scheme, iâve worked 7 years with contribution and is just awful.
If i was begging at a street corner for 7 years probably i would have x100 more then i have with this pension scheme.
It is very hard for a young person to get to put something in the side when these kind of companies are acting like there are some sort of babies that is using your money to invest in some milk powder companies.
I can even say how much i should have based on all the contribution i had over 7 years and what i actually have, i can say only that probably when i get to retire i will be able to buy at least a garage to sleep in it.
Iâm just gonna transfer my money into a SIPP account and iâm gonna invest in a company that iâm pretty sure in 20 years is gonna bring me more than this pension scheme in 500 years of contribution.

Absolutely awful company to deal with. Only way of communicating with them is via their portal on your online account and then it takes them about 10 days to respond.

The interface for nest pensions website is so basic that it hard to see whatâs happening to your pension pot. I think mines actually declined in value but hard to know as it just tells you a total. They are also not very proactive in suggesting or nudging people to consider options for growing their pot or nudging to increase pension contributions - the average person thinks that contributing the government required minimum (5%) is enough when really they should be trying to contribute a lot more per month. Once you decide to contribute more the tax situation is really unclear - it confused me as I though this could only be claimed if it was direct from you salary contribution but turns out you still get tax benefits if you contribute additional amounts from your bank. Once you have decided to contribute on a monthly basis and want to understand how your pension pot is growing - thereâs literally no information other than the total - I want to know how the pot is growing over time and if Iâm on track etc and thing I can consider to help grow it,,,,,,1.0,

I thought I had finally been successful applying again 2 months ago, only to be told that it hadn't registered on their system despite me receiving an acknowledgement email from them. I rang them a month ago and had to go through the whole process again. During which time my payment is now Â£392 less than my contributions as the stock market investing my money in is losing money daily and has reduced by Â£143 in 2 months. The service is appalling, each time I have phoned I have been fobbed off with excuses and delay tactics. I've lost count how many times I have had to verify myself, answer the same questions and tick the same boxes on their forms. They tell me they will do something or post letters to me, so far I have received only one letter and form (which I had completed online 2 months ago), and returned to them by post. Now they are saying they sent me a verification code in the post, which I haven't received and that it will take a further 15 working days after they get the code from me before I can expect to receive my money. Meanwhile they still have my money which is losing value everyday they wont freeze it at the date I applied. If the stock market crashes tomorrow technically I could lose the lot.",,,,,,1.0,

Very disappointing. I have tried to have my pension transferred to another pension scheme so there all in one pot and nest keep declining it. Itâs the same rubbish on phone on how my name on policy is set as my second name is my first name. Apparently itâs the information my work place gave. All correspondence from nest over the years clearly shows my middle name is separate from first name. I sent them details of proof of name and they declined it. They are making money from my pension and by time I retire there will be no money left in it. Iâve not been with nest for 6 months now and the job Iâm in does not use nest pension and never will as I work for the NHS so I want my pension transferred. I have repeated myself by sending documents again. Thereâs no communication as they have never contacted me to let me know they declined it. Iâm chasing them up. Disappointment is an understatement,,,,,,1.0,
"I'm not generally one for bad reviews but the bereavements department are the most blooming bureaucratic and inefficient bunch I've ever come across. Not that I've ever actually managed to speak to anyone in the department!!!! Every time I've called I have to play Chinese whispers with the call centre staff (who to be fair do try to be helpful). I can't actually talk to them for some completely inexplicable reason plus they don't do email - the only other option is the postal service. The Royal Mail is not particularly quick and these days not particularly reliable either. For a company set up in the [PhoneNumber]s it's a hell of a lot like dealing with a company in the 80s aside from the fact you don't have a fax number. My mum set it up so the money in her pension would be split 50/50 with me and my brother. It should be so blooming simple - It's taken SIX BLOOMING MONTHS so far. Things get lost in the post, I've sent them documents which they have acknowledged receipt of (via letter) but then told me they have not received when called. I would dearly love to be able to discuss this with someone at a management level preferably in the Bereavements department.",,,,,,1.0,
"Very untrustworthy. I asked fir my funds 12/8/22. I put the wrong payout date as 19/9/22 not 19/8/22.
I immediately rang nest. Was told to go on site and change date. This was not possible I rang again told date could be changed in 3 days. Not possible I sent a complaint they rang said my money had been processed and check account should be in. Rang on the Wednesday told money in account by Friday No money as of the Friday rang again put on to pension transfer team not even processed yet. No one knows what they are talking about. I would move any money out of nest to another pension scheme this one is a joke.

"My fiance's late mother held a pension with [Company X], and the experience of trying to claim this for himself and his brother has been nothing short of a nightmare. He first contacted them back in March after she sadly passed away, and six months later they still haven't transferred the money. It takes them forever to contact us if they need us to do something, and that's if they even bother contacting us at all.

First of all it took forever for them to process several documents, many of which such as the will or the grant of probate are not actually needed to claim a pension as a beneficiary, as pensions are separate from the estate. Then several weeks after sending in the grant of probate and having it sent back to us with a letter of acknowledgement, having heard absolutely nothing about how the claim was progressing, my fiancÃ© phoned them, only be told they hadn't received it (despite them sending it back, with the acknowledgement letter). It was only after speaking to someone who wasn't incompetent that they found it on their system. If he hadn't called them they clearly wouldn't have bothered to check this.

A few weeks later when we'd still heard nothing he phoned again to find out what was happening, at which point they said they were waiting for his brother to send back the relevant forms. He claimed he'd already done this once. They sent the forms again, which he sent back, only to today be told when calling that they hadn't received anything. Twice now they've supposedly not received these forms. What do we do when they say they haven't received them on the third attempt?

This is getting absolutely ridiculous. We are getting fed up with waiting and being messed about like this, and the complete lack of communication, especially when Aviva, the other company my fiance's late mother held a pension with, finalised the transfer of funds back in May. We will need this money as part of buying a house so we can't just sit about waiting indefinitely for them to finally get their act together!

All I can say is, I feel very sorry for anyone who currently holds and is claiming a pension from [Company X], as it must be a never ending nightmare.",,,,,,1.0,

Then I got a letter back, we do not understand your request please complete attached from Richard Hardy, (no form attached). First time I spoke to an Indian lady, they did not seem to care, on the borders of being rude. Wonder if company is going broke or perhaps the staff are incompetent.

"I decided to take out this scheme as my employer would be making contributions. It has been running for a couple of years and I only make the minimum payments from my wage which is very low as work part-time. My latest statement says I have had total contributions of approx Â£[PhoneNumber] including mine, employers and tax benefits. My pot value is Â£20 less so after a few years of regular contributions after charges I am worse off. The only consolation for me is I have previous pension plans combined in one place, not nest, which are doing very well and intend to drawdown over the next 20 years. I will not be relying on [Company X] for my retirement. My Marcus easy access account is paying 1.5% currently and would have been a better investment. This is a Government inspired scheme need I say more. Investors are being scammed, where is the growth to give people a benefit at retirement with inflation running above 10% the value of investment is being destroyed.

"I have over Â£[PhoneNumber] invested with [Company X] pensions. Every month I religiously pay a fixed sum into my [Company X] pension.
[Company X]'s latest pension forecast was perposterous. It erroneously forecast that I will only pay in just over Â£[PhoneNumber] in the next 16 years. To date I have paid in over Â£[PhoneNumber] in 2 and-a-half years. The annual pension payout on retirement forecast is derisory.
Is this a case of woeful incompetence on the past of [Company X]? Or, am I looking at something more sinister?
I have complained twice before to [Company X]. To date they have not answered my questions. If they do not answer my concerns directly and provide a correct pension forecast before the end of August then they will leave me no alternative but to complaint to The Pensions Regulator. I am also considering contacting Action Fraud. Had I known [Company X] would be this inept I would never have taken out a pension with them. [Company X] is a stakeholder pension set-up by government.

I have also made a formal complaint to the FCA and will be starting a campaign to ensure all companies in the Uk do not use nest and those who do to switch over immediatelyâ¦ They DO NOT care about you just your money

Update!!

Still no payment 10 weeks now, as a terminal Ill this is just ridiculous I will be dead by the time I get it and it will be to late to make memories with my family!!

My complaint has now moved again from the resolution being today but now itâs the 15th another 10 days!! I think best is just hoping for me to die from my Illness rather then deal with me!!

"Review of making additional contributions to [Company X] -

Making additional contributions is easy and straightforward. The fees are a small negative, but overall I'm confident the charges will be lower over the long term than some other schemes.

I would rather my employer would allow me to increase my contributions and match it out of my paycheck, that way I could pay more into my pension and get the added bonus of my employer paying more also. The current fixed employer contribution ratios are too low - why not give individuals the flexibility to request more of a (matched) contribution if they want to? Surely a win win for employees, retirees and [Company X]? Why isn't the government pushing this?",,,,,,1.0,
"Once again unable to login, Captcha not activating!
This is a frequent issue, along with poor information to advise if the issue is with other login functions.

Chat seems to be very slow, the bot is helpful, understanding but I fear lacks any authority. ""I'll inform Tech dept"" Nada.
Now we're receiving notification about non payments, but how can we pay with no access to this lame system? Once again the chat bot was non effective.
trying to make any real contact with this organisation to complain is seemingly not available, the contact avenues are minimal, frustratingly difficult to negotiate and time wasting.

"I cannot understand how this system is allowed to function.
I have been enrolled on a pension, where the only way to opt-out is after they have taken the initial money.

You can only opt-out within a 1 month period. After this period it is then not possible to return any of the money taken from you. (until you retire)

In order to opt-out, you need to receive a pack in the post from nest. This pack always arrives after the 1 month period, making it 100% impossible to have the money returned to you.

When you contact nest, they say it is the employer's responsibility to send out the pack. As the employer, this is not the case and it is nest who sends out the packs.

This is a scam and needs to be investigated by the regulator. [Company X] could quite easily email the ""nest identifier"" but chooses to select a method which guarantees the user cannot opt-out.

I will be making sure to select accountants who do not use this dreadful company for pensions.

"Their processes are set up to slow you down and customer service is atrocious.

Iâve been opted into Nestâs pension scheme by my previous employer as unfortunately thatâs the only option they offered. After my departure the payroll have notified [Company X] that my contributions will end and I have also messaged them via their system, with view of transferring my pot out to another provider.
Instead of responding to me first, they cancelled my request and told me afterwards that they donât know that no more contributions will be received, despite receiving the information from me directly and from the payroll company. I manually changed the contributions setting via their website and had my preferred provider re-submit the request only for them to receive a response that [Company X] is awaiting my âfinal contributionâ to clear. That was received almost 2 months after I flagged that no contributions will be coming in, after the final one was already issued.
The person dealing with my request did not answer when asked why they cancelled my request without consultation via their inbox.

For transfers out they also donât have a way for document submission online and expect people to send in physical documents including IDs via post, which they then have to send back. Technologically thatâs very behind and opens the possibility of the documents being lost.

On top of that, the company positions itself as focused on the environment and yet invests the funds into airlines, mines and fossil fuels with the details of investments opaque at best and specific hard to find.

AVOID AVOID AVOID.

Update: the response from customer service below indicates that they didnât quite understand what happened. My company notified [Company X] on 22 June that contribution made at the end of the previous month. May was the final one. At the end of July [Company X] claimed that theyâre still âclearing my final contributionâ. Two months is a long time to clear a contribution if you ask me. Iâve now managed to transfer out, but Iâm yet to receive my passport back. Given their website information it should have arrived back to me already but it has not.",,,,,,1.0,

Auto enrolment within 3 months, auto enrolment every 3 years after that, 1 month window to opt out, patchy support to employers from [Company X], delayed or missing employer packs as a result of [Company X] incompetence, making it difficult for employees to login, making it more difficult for them to opt out!

Every employee should get an option of an SMS, email and posted pack which informs them how it all works, highlighting the downsides of a pension as well as the upsides discussing alternatives such as SIPPs.",,,,,,1.0,

The website is not good, so difficult to navigate, with links that take you in circles. The website looks like it was designed in the 90âs and behaves as such, the opposite of intuitive.
The absolute main problem is a fundamental one. I have absolutely no idea how my pension is doing. Best gives you absolutely no indication of the performance of your portfolio. The best way I have worked out is by noting down what the average price paid is and trying to compare this with past investment prices. It is also incredibly difficult to find out basic information about what the different investment options are, I.e. what are the different investments the portfolios are made up of.
I have no choice to use [Company X] at the moment as it is the provider my employer uses. However, I have a personal pension using Vanguard and the difference is night and day. Itâs almost comical how poor [Company X] is in comparison. I have within three clicks a detailed breakdown of the different constituent parts of my portfolio, and also a detailed historic breakdown of my purchase prices and the performance of my portfolio as it notes my average buying price against the current market. This is a fundamental tool which I cannot believe isnât part of the [Company X] platform.
The fees [Company X] charges are also astronomically high. As well as charge for investing, they charge an incredibly high management fee, when compared against the rest of the market.

"I'm an employer. Have a LTD. I'm hiring myself and now one more employee.
[Company X] was the choice of my accountants, so to make things simple I've signed up with [Company X].
1. First thing after reading the [Company X] annual report. You pride yourself with having 25% of ""our workforce are from a Black, Asian or another ethnic minority community"" - yet all 11 board members are white. Going with your math 3 people in the board should or could be from ethnic minority.
In your PDF report you have stock pictures of people from Getty images and other websites. You show 34 people. 16 are white - 47% (7 men - 20% and 9 women - 27%) and the rest of the pictures show people of colour 21 people that 53% ( 6 men - 18% and 12 women - 35%). It's a bit of ""ethnic washing"" don't you think?
2. I appreciate the fact that the government want to take care of our ""pensions"". Why not increasing the PAYE/NIC contribution to give people a good retirement they can actually live on? The GOV could invest those money in building more houses that all of us need and is the safest options of investment. But no, let's create a separate entity to collect the extra contributions. So now there are two entities collecting contributions. Two board of directors, Two of everything doing the same job. At the best part of it is, at the bottom of the [Company X] report you can read: ""Return of your
investment is not guaranteed as the value of investments can go down
as well as up"". So [Company X] is promising 3% return above the inflation. But there's no guarantee. But they take [PhoneNumber] Â£ on the low side every year to pay for 11 board members. Some of the have 5 more jobs in other companies. If I was spending 16% of my time for my company it would bankrupt.
3. The website. I made a mistake while setting up an employee. Wrong email address. I couldn't delete it, because that random person who got the email from [Company X] logged in.
I was trying live chat. No help. I had to spend 25 min on the phone with a man from CS who helped me create a CSV file in a notepad on my computer and upload it to the website to delete a simple mistake. I don't have time for things like that. If I'm on the phone the CS person should be able to help me over the phone. Not guide me to create some files.

"Where do I start? I am an ex Army & Civil Servant who has been working for various private sector Companies since I left. I had pensions with a few different pensions providers and decided to move them into â one pot â with one provider. I wasnât that fussed about which provider it was. I have 3 small pension pots: one with Aviva, one with [Company X], one with The Peoples Pension. I decided to move the small amounts into The Peoples Pension simply for the reason they were my current Employerâs pension of choice. Aviva weâre wonderful and the process was simple and straightforward. At the time of writing , [Company X] have still not completed the process. I have spent hours trying to resolve the matter, far too many phone calls, and even submitted a complaint. And yet STILL they wonât transfer. They deserve this review, indeed, I am so annoyed with [Company X] I am submitting it at 5.30 in the morning. Donât use them. Their â front of house â Staff are very polite and helpfulâ¦.. their â Transfer Team â ?? Shockingly bad. Borderline useless.

â Iâm now waiting for ABBIE the auto-bot to give her â stock â response ð¤¬

Update 10/7/22 - so? After over one month, 20+ phone calls , a complaint, speaking to two Managers, and my new pension firm B&CE / The People Pension ( fab by the way ) badgering [Company X] to release MY money? It has boiled down to this â I have to fill in and return a form for Pension Wise ( yea no idea who they are either ð¤¬ ) the form arrives and guess what?? I donât even need to SIGN IT!!!!! I informed [Company X] I could opt out of this, on the phone , and yet STILL they wanted ME to put the ticks in the boxes and also PAY to send the form back!!!! You couldnât make this up. What a joke of a Company â¦.. oh? And last manager I spoke to called Jackson stated, and I quote â would you like me to submit a complaint for you? â â¦.. er??? I submitted one weeks ago, so donât make a lot of difference mate ð¤¬â¦. Do yourself a favour - if you are reading this???? CHOOSE another company, as this lot? Seem to take great pleasure in making what should be, a painless and easy process , into making you have mild feelings of wanting to inflict violence on something. Unbelievable just donât cut it.

Footnote - I see ABBIE the â real personâ has responded to me â¦Well hello Abbie. I have no doubt you are a lovely person, however, EVERYTHING you have suggested and more ( lots more ) has been done. So short of sending a hard nosed Gunslinger to your offfices to demand my money back? Well? I am all out of ideas. And the Information you require? Wow! Been sent to you in triplicate and still your shoddy company wonât budge.

Thanks for your â reply/helpâ but itâs not help. And does not achieve anything. Do yourself a favour? Get another job with a real company that actually care

Update [PhoneNumber] - form filled in, sent back, they confirm theyâve had it and â¦.. STILL havenât moved MY money. Utterly disgraceful

Final Update 18/8/22 - so, I have FINALLY been able to move my money from [Company X] to The Peoples Pension. THEE most useless Company I have ever come across. If your trying to move your money, and reading this? Youâll know exactly what Iâm on about. AFTER the transfer of funds, they then had the cheek to write to me ( on the back of my complaint! ) saying they had closed the complaint and that it was MY fault for not sending a â Pension Wiseâ form back to them sooner!!!!!

"I'm getting seriously concerned about my [Company X] pension. I retired in April this year and applied to have my small [Company X] pension paid to me in full (less any tax due). I sent the necessary evidence of my bank account in March (a voided blank cheque) and completed the online forms via my [Company X] login and then went on holiday expecting a payment to be forthcoming around the end of April. I received 3 telephone messages whilst on holiday which I couldn't pick up or return until 15th May when I got home. Apparently there was another form I needed to complete and instead of just sending this they rang! After 10 days the form hadn't arrived so I chased it up, they sent another which arrived approximately 5 days later, I duly completed and returned by Special delivery on 6th June.
At this point I discovered that once your account has 'gone to the retirement team' you no longer have access to it which I find extremely worrying.
I then waited another week then received a phone call from them on 11th June when they confirmed they had received the form and would now action it! Why not just action it when they received it? Apparently nothing is done until you speak to them.
On 16th June I received an email asking me to log into my account to read an email (!) and on 17th June a text message asking me to log in (!). Why ask me to do this when they know I can no longer access this?
So I rang again on 17th June and spoke to the 'Escalation Team' who advised they needed ID which I sent (original ID) by Special Delivery the same day and was returned to me 22nd June with a note saying my 'evidence is in review'. The Escalation Team said payment would then be made within a few days. I rang again today, 24th June and the advisor tried to tell me they need ID (!!!) then told me they needed evidence of my bank account at which point I crossly pointed out it had been sent in March.
I am at a loss and extremely worried as I have a rough idea of the figure due and just don't seem to be able to convey my concern about receiving MY MONEY. I stupidly was making additional monthly contributions for the last eighteen months thinking it was the safest place to save this. I thought this was a safe Government scheme?!

I have a small pot with nest and have come to the age where i can take it all in cash.Firstly my pot took a hit just before my retirement date 10% just disappeared. now it comes to taking my money and i want it putting in my credit union account and no way do they want to do that. every possible reason not to pay my funds into my credit union account has been given. This is the same account my state benefits are paid into and statements of that account have been provided at their request now the issue is with [BankDetail] [BankDetail] the [BankDetail] [BankDetail] not belong to me but to the credit union. so the credit union have issued them with a statement confirming my account and how to pay the funds direct to that account. Still no money just phone calls telling me of the difficulties they are having confirming my account.They have a very poor telephone service call backs are promised and never happen staff only want you to hear what they have to say about YOUR money and when you demand to be paid the money they hold for you they shut down and say that you are not listening to them when the truth is they just will not listen to you. do not save with these people it is not worth the risk there are many many much better and far more reputable options out there,,,,,,1.0,

Why would you want an annual investment of 3% anyway? Did I mention they 2.1% for charges every year? So you are left with less than a percent investment. If not for your employers and government contributions you would gain almost nothing. Even having a regular savings account is better and less restrictive than this. You cant get your money until you are 55 years old and even then you don't get all of it.

"[Company X] is quite a sophisticated investment platform for retirement saving with a strong ethical/ESG filter. It's wrong to call it a pension, because basically you just save up a big lump sum that you use to live off when you retire. And at the moment you have to transfer that lump sum away from [Company X] to another investment company to access your savings.

Working out the increase in the value of your savings pot each year, aside from the extra money you and your employer have paid in, is not easy.

It's also expensive for older workers as they take 1.8% of everything that is paid in up front in charges, which is pretty high. The ongoing charge is quite low though, at only 0.3%. Over the long term this is good value for younger members (aged [PhoneNumber] perhaps), but pretty rubbish for anyone over 55 as they don't have as long for the high initial charge to be mitigated by the lower annual charge.",,,,,,1.0,

[Company X] broke pretty much every FCA regulation when I complained, yet FCA doesn't seem to care as this is the government sanctioned pension provider for UK workers. Pretty much says all you need to know, set up by the UK government, seemingly run from a foreign country and pretty terrible when trying to actually do anything apart from transferring money to them, they make that easy :-) My advice is avoid like the plague, god only knows what they will be like paying out your workplace pension, Pretty sure their returns are one of the worst on the market too.",,,,,,1.0,

This company is a disgrace. If it wasnât for the fact it is used in many workplace pensions then I couldnât see how they could survive. God inly knows where the Call Centre is based as the communication is so so poor.

I will definitely be going to the Ombudsman about this atrocious company.,,,,,,1.0,
"Website/portal is terrible. I get locked out every time I try to access it, along with the messages that I must follow the link in the email they have sent me. Unfortunately, they haven't sent me an email or link. Typical of an agency forced on to you by the government (I'm not anti-government, I'm anti bull) I suppose I could move my pension to someone else - but I can't access it.
Edit: Just come off chat with them. Don't waste your time. Delaying tactics. ""Please allow me a minute to read your previous conversation"". All 150 words took 5 minutes. I gave up.
My advice, get it while you can or avoid if you're thinking of joining them. I hate to think of what will happen if I pop my clogs/snuff it/ croak/ slip my mortal coil/ die. I have no idea how my wife will deal with them. This company needs a full financial review, urgently. Those of you who say how great it is... How many have had issues that need resolving? Most of the 5* reviews are from people who've just joined. It's your money at risk. Think carefully.
Edit:
Finally spoke to someone. Closed the account. Because the account is closed I can no longer access the portal - makes sense. Then, the next day, I received an email telling me to log in to my account to view an important message from them. So now another phone call, another 40 minutes on hold, to find out what this message is about - probably telling me I can no longer access my account online. Pity can only give 1 star.",,,,,,1.0,

My boss from my other job enrolled me without my permission to this [Company X]. Until I started my new job and 3 months working with them. I notice this [Company X] taking my money on my wage slip. I asked about this to my new boss in which they said your old company who I worked for enrolled me. That's why it got pushed forward to my new job. They're opt me out straight away as I told them I don't want this private pension scheme with [Company X]. I saw her do this and she told me to phone them up as well to cancel it. Well that's fun and games. Rang them twice and they said they have no record of me. Sorry you have taken Â£18 out of my wages. You do have a record of me. I gave a really snotty email to my old boss to opt me out as well as he had no permission to do this. So he most of done this when I asked him to. It has taken [Company X] a whole month to sort this out and I've just got an email from them that the new job I'm in has enrolled me to [Company X]. So I had to now open an account with them to shut this down. Once I did this I have no funds apparently with [Company X]. So where has this Â£18 gone? Now I've got to wait 3 days to opt myself out as I can't do this earlier apparently. So more money taking out of my monthly wage this month. Don't trust these conmen.

"I have a weird love/hate relationship with [Company X]. It is a good idea in principle and the execution is okay. Some ideas like their automatic nest egg and pension vault thingies they are trialing with some companies or are planning are actually exciting. That's the stuff people probably don't know they need!

However, as someone who knows about how to invest for himself, the available funds are... lackluster. Never mind that your money is invested in low yield assets early on in the investment cycle (you should instead go all in on risk early on for higher expected returns), the more annoying issue is that for the standard and even higher risk fund, half of the main globally diversified equity part is currency-hedged. You don't hedge equity if you hold it for decades, it just dampens your returns for no good reason. I expect the funds to leave a lot of money on the table therefore, and needlessly so. I understand that these things make your pension pot swing less and that appeases the plebs who think the stock market is a casino, but please let me take the training wheels off somehow (e.g. for the higher risk fund).

And then there are the actively managed sub-funds for some asset classes, i.e. property and high yield bonds last time I looked. I still don't fully understand if their costs are included in the 0.3% annual [Company X] fund cost or are invisibly subtracted from their returns, as the support people don't seem to understand what I'm asking them. Many don't seem to be publicly listed, so I can't get fact-sheets on them. The intransparency is irking me bad. I would also much prefer to only use passively managed funds because I know that most active managers underperform in the long run.

I was interested in their ethical fund but then found out it's a fund of actively managed funds with a tiny number of underlying investments. Guh. The sharia fund looked interesting but I can't get information about the underlying index, so I don't want to invest in it. Bummer.

The last item on my list is their transaction history. I keep books on my investments and the way transactions are listed on their site is annoying to scrape. I have to keep an extra sheet where I back-calculate the fees on transactions so I can enter the correct numbers in my books. I can't then get current fund prices because they list only select funds in fund databases (or you scrape their PDFs, no thanks) and markets.ft.com seems to provide unreliable price history or scraping fails. Grr.

So basically, I'd prefer if they gave me more choice in how my money is invested. Their choices look very questionable to me from multiple angles.",,,,,,1.0,

Well, after two months of continuous calls and waiting, they havenât transferred the funds yet. I donât understand what are they waiting for. Whenever I call asking for clarification they always reply with a silly excuse.
Please, avoid them as the black death.

I'm still dealing with this issue and they keep me bouncing me back with many weird excuses. I have probably made 100 phone calls so far.

Iâm still dealing with these people since September [PhoneNumber] and I havenât received my money yet. They are holding my funds against my will and it is a criminal offence.
Iâve never ever been so frustrated.
Today I called them 5 times and despite having a full phone signal the line kept dropping.
I really donât know what to do anymore.

"Despite hearing nothing about [Company X] for years, my previous impression from years ago was not very good. This seemed to be backed up by a lot of negative comments I read while looking at it for my daughter recently, however...
while not expecting much I contacted them a few weeks ago about using them with my current company as well as for some questions my daughter had. The person I spoke to was nice, very helpful, and very knowledgeable, changing my mind about how my daughter and I could use them to our benefit.
Comparing them to the 7 private pension companies I have dealt with over the past 12 months they were much more helpful and responsive, and also more flexible than I expected.
In summary, if they are the only option your employer offers don't worry as they are very helpful and offer a good service. At the very least it will allow you to get your employer's contribution and a tax rebate added to what you put in so potentially adding a lot to your investment at the start. (ask your company for the actual figures!) And, you can transfer out to another pension when you leave your employer if you want. IMO their growth performance is ok, and they beat some of the big name pension funds that I can't mention here. There are plenty of free sites that will provide info on that for you, so do your own research before you make a decision as things change over time!",,,,,,1.0,

"My interactions with [Company X] are mostly from an employer perspective, as I do my own payroll and calculate my and my employer's monthly pension contributions (I work for a local council as the only employee), so I very rarely login as a ""customer"". But so far I have no real reason to complain. It's not a bad system once you get used to it. It wasn't straightforward to set up at first, but I think that's more the confusing nature of pensions rather than [Company X]. Their guidance was helpful though, with ""decision trees"" to help you understand what steps you need to take according to different circumstances, and template letters to send to the employer and employee (i.e. myself), to make sure we were fulfilling legal requirements for the Pensions Regulator.

As a customer, I did look into transferring some smaller pensions from previous jobs into [Company X] to simplify things, but there are some restrictions which is a bit annoying, but such is life. It's helpful being able to see the estimated pension pot value at retirement, and annual pension I could potentially be able to take. I'll have a few decades of working life left (hopefully!) before I start looking at taking any of it, so I can't really comment on that at this stage though.",,,,,,1.0,

"A friend received a small pension fund (gross value Â£134) from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and was sent initial documents from [Company X]. He sought to retrieve this as a lump sum.

He logged onto their website which was misleading and difficult to navigate. He called their helpline and was given advice to close the account and that the MOJ would pay him the pension directly as a lump sum.

Having heard nothing for several months he contacted the MOJ who told him he would not be paid by the MOJ and that he needed to re-enrol with [Company X].

Two months later [Company X] wrote with new login details for their website. Several attempts to recover the money online failed and eventually he contacted the [Company X] helpline again. Incoherent advice regarding using the website proved useless and eventually a 15 page paper form arrived which is in the process of being sent to [Company X]. The form has some double negative questions with Yes / No answer tick boxes. He has drawn Nestâs attention to this as it could lead to an incorrect answer and yet more delays.

It has taken 10 months so far and it remains to be seen if the money will make its way into his bank account. If told me that if he could give [Company X] a zero star rating he would.

He said it is extraordinary that the MOJ chose this organisation to administer pension funds and that questions need to be answered regarding the selection process.",,,,,,1.0,

Trying to transfer a pension out and they make the process so laboured and difficult it makes you feel like screaming.
They're still antiquated and not completing this process electronically , instead wanting additional sensitive documents sending backwards and forwards despite already having you're identity verified.
Their secure/private email service only allows such small files to be unloaded that you can't even send a single page document or photo without a lot of messing about and knowing how to complete the process of resizing/compressing files on your computer.
The FCA and ombudsman need to force companies like this to quickly and efficiently comply with customer requests and their rights to transfer their pension pots.",,,,,,1.0,

I am finding out that the true value of a pension company tends to become apparent when reaching retirement.

"I initially really liked this pension provider. The online portal is informative although very basic. It also has a chat facility which seemed fast and normally issues were able to sort most queries out. I also like interactive online services. It wasnât always clear but it had potential. So what changed?

I decided to change to another pension provider where I can control investments. Thatâs where problems started.

I had heard that [Company X] was particularly bad at transferring out, finding excuses and delaying, according to a few independent pension advisors.

So, being a little concerned after the process started with my chosen company, I contacted [Company X] via chat. I explained that I was transferring out and wanted to know if things were running smoothly from their end. The said there were no issues. But nevertheless I asked them to double check to see if I needed to do anything to ensure the process happened as quickly as possible, without delay. They agreed to check took a while to investigate but confirmed that I had no need to worry, everything was fine, I didnât need to do anything. They told me it would take 4 weeks from initially receiving the request to completion. Therefore, I was relieved and didnât think any more of it.

When we entered into the following month [Company X] left a secure message saying because I had not unchecked a tab in the dashboard confirming end of contributions from the employer the transfer would be discontinued. I immediately looked at the dashboard clicked the tab as instructed. I did this the moment I got the message.

I was hoping they would immediately see they had previously checked and made a mistake by not advising me correctly, and as I had acted as soon as I found out of their error.

So I complained via chat explaining that [Company X] has checked everything beforehand. I also explained that my ex- employer didnât contribute anyway. I got nowhere. So I completed a secure complaint but it said that they would not reply within 10 days. I also send an email to nest pension head office.

So what is the big deal you might ask? Well, I rely on a representative telling me the truth, and being held accountable if they make mistakes. The delay in pension transfer extends the completed transfer by 2 months because they cancelled it and it had to start all over again. I also have to wait for the next month.

What else could be disturbing? Well, if a pension company holds into your pension, they are using your money to invest. In this case I have longer to wait before I can invest and contribute than what is typical. Basically, they are costing me money.

I am not happy with their customer service or inability to resolve issues that they have caused.

This company has potential to be a good company but there Customer service is awful. The delay in proper responses that donât include chat are very slow. 10 days is too long.

Their accountability seems to be non existent.

"So difficult to deal with.
My employer was usig [Company X] so I auto enrolled, it seemed smooth with a website made in when windows XP was in its prime, with bare to none online help, expensive chargeable phone number and a stupid mailbox system. Stick with paper. I'm trying to transfer my funds out of [Company X] to another company and it has taken me about 6 months now because [Company X] are being so difficult. Now they are saying I require professional advice from a financial advisor before I can. I'm like what, are you going to pay for that then?

"Reached the age I could withdraw some funds from my pension and started the process 23rd August.

Called to discuss then raised the request online. Submitted the requested proof of ID straight after requesting the withdrawal.

According to their online guide it should take 5 - 10 working days. No automated response to acknowledge the request or the proof of ID.

Chased via the chat system 28th August, not much help other than to say 'we are processing'

Email received 30th to acknowledge receipt of proof of ID and would contact if any further info required.

Chased via chat 3rd September - still processing, but unable to confirm when anything will be done.

7th September received email 2:29am asking for proof of ID, so I called them the 8:30am. They acknowledged they had the proof of ID and didn't need any more. Claimed it was because it was high value and it was with compliance to investigate.

Received email 10th September saying relevant team working on it and delays in approving the claim.

This isn't an insurance claim that needs approval, this is my money that I am entitled to.
13th September now, 15th working day and no update.

How any modern organisation can have a policy that they will respond to emails in 10 working days amazes me. Chat operators unable to do anything but apologise, call operators that can't transfer to a manager or any other department. Nobody capable of answering a simple question like ""when will I get my money"" or ""what is being checked that is taking so long""

edit: 17th September

[Company X] 'approved' my withdrawal 14th September (not long after this review was posted)

The funds didn't show as withdrawn until 16th Spetember, I couldn't get confirmation in writing that it had been transferred on the 14th until this morning (17th)

They phoned to confirm transfer had started, I questioned why it would take 3-5 days to transfer, when most banks allow almost instant transfer. It was explained that it wasn't just a transfer, but de-investment of my funds before transfer.

So the 5-10 days claimed by the website, turned into 16 working days to approve, plus 3-5 more days to get the money. All of which is mostly internal processing that isn't explained or communicated anywhere.

Raised a complaint with them. They aim to respond within 20 working days - so guess I'll hear sometime after Christmas :)

Edit: 22/09/[PhoneNumber]

Called a couple of time to confirm money was being transferred, was promised that the money would be in my account by end of day 21st.

22nd now and no money.

Started chat call as I can save the text as proof and was informed the money would be in my account 27th. No explanation of what has happened or why I was told one thing and they have changed.

Asked for callback from a manager (asked by name for the Member Services Manager that had sent me email). Expect that the call will come back from somebody that can't answer anything again.

Haven't had any written confirmation of my raised complaint, as apparently their internal 'secure messages' take 48 hours to deliver.

About time [Company X] invested in some modern IT systems and processes.

Edit 25/09/[PhoneNumber] in response to [Company X] reply:

The money still isn't in my account and I've not had a call from anybody despite being promised several times that somebody from complaints or management would be calling be.

I understand the need for checking identity - but without any communication it appears as if nothing is being done. My Home Office Security Clearance was processed in less than a week. A withdrawal of funds from my pension should not take longer than that.

A process that isn't working shouldn't be treated as a complaint (with a 20 day response) - it should be treated as an urgent issue that should be responded immediately.

I tried to log in to my account...could not..phoned up was told account closed...two different advisors cannot tell me when my money will be paid....finally so angry that I have sent formal complaint..

So what you might say, it's free money? Well it's not really to be honest because if your on a low wage your 3% contribution might buy you a couple of pints and a kebab now but in 30 years it might equal a loaf of bread if your lucky. you'd be better off investing your 3% at the bookies to be brutally honest, much better returns and you access your pot immediately.

Contacted the helpline on the error message for the log in page and it was explained that I had to contact a different number as that line is for employees only.
Contacted the new number and they wanted an ID from a page on the account that I cant log into.

[Company X] make it very difficult to get any customer service help and even when you do speak to a person they basically cannot help, they seem to have very little knowledge or ability to think through solutions - the agents just keep repeating what they can't do and why things are the way they are. I have a pension at Legal and General and the difference is huge, the agents there are aware that it's their job to figure out how to help the customer. [Company X] also allowed my previous employer to not pay contributions for many months without taking any significant action and were very little help or support with recouping funds. I just now want to move the small amount of pension I have from them but as another review commented they close your account on receipt of a transfer request and from that point the very poor customer service shifts to no customer service. There was little or no effort on the part of the agents to contact the receiving fund or other departments to sort out a query - just trotting out repeatedly why they couldn't / wouldn't help. There was a solution available in the end but only after getting extremely stressed with the phone agents was it suggested. A horrible experience and if any future employer uses this scheme I would opt out.",,,,,,1.0,
"Avoid at all costs. Very poor returns on your money if you ever manage to wade through the chaos they enjoy creating when you decide to withdraw it.

They are now insisting I send original documents i.e. my passport, marriage cert and bank statements through the post yet they will not provide an alternative email address as they say their email is the only secure way to send docs!! I have held my bank account for years and I am so angry they are making me jump through hoops. Extremely rude customer service who spoke over me when I was trying to explain. No help at all and I can see no way of accessing my money. I fear if I send originals they are so incompetent I will never see them again or worse still I will become a victim of ID fraud.

"Web site is fine, call centre people try their best but a word of warning when requesting to draw out money. First they close your account 5 days after the withdrawal date requested, so the only communication you can have is by phone although they keep sending you emails that you need your account open to read. Secondly I have just had my pot paid out 64 days after requesting a withdrawal date and 34 days after that actual withdrawal date.

This high contribution fee has stopped me making additional contributions to [Company X]",,,,,,1.0,

"I had no say in whether I wanted to be with this shambles of an organisation, my temp agency auto-enrolled me after three months (they are required by law to do so apparently). You have to choose to opt out, which you can only do *after* you have been enrolled (which [Company X] makes as difficult as it can), giving them the opportunity to take a few weeks' money and 'lose' it.

[Company X] takes full advantage of this captive market by providing a terrible 'service' that they would never get away with if people had to opt in rather than opt out after they have been auto-enrolled as a fait accompli.

Several weeks of contributions have been deducted from my payslip, but their website claimed no contributions have been received to date. I have emailed complaints about it but heard nothing back so far. They also claim to have sent three letters to my home address (there were PDFs on the account inbox) but none of those were received either. I'm seeing a pattern forming here.

I tried speaking to someone called Mayur on their online chat today to ask why no contributions were showing when there are several weeks of deductions on my payslip. He immediately passed the buck back to my employer in typical ""computer says no"" fashion. He insisted no money had been received. I suspected I was speaking to a bot because there were a lot of generic responses but Mayur insisted he was a human.

I then did take up his suggestion of getting back to the employer (Hays) and they said the deductions are taken directly by [Company X] themselves.

So I have exercised my right to opt out to prevent any further money being taken out. If I don't get the money already paid back, I will go to the Pension Regulator and the small claims court if need be.

Oh, and the moment you do opt out, you get no access to your account any more, so make sure you take screenshots and download any PDFs first for evidence!",,,,,,1.0,

I raised a complaint got a letter saying final response would be received by 9/7/21 am still waiting. I am a non TAX payer but apparently only 25% is tax free what a joke, each time you call you get a different answer. Although they are open on saturdays the business does not accept post.

Applied to have my pension transferred back (from [Company X]) in April [PhoneNumber] and still waiting (July [PhoneNumber] and counting). It has just occurred to them now to ask for proof of my identity (something not mentioned at the start of the process). The transfer process is uniquely tedious and I would rate the communication as frustrating at best. Why? Because they knowingly hold information back so they can claim the interest on your pot. The longer you're with them the more money they make off you. Do yourselves a favour guys and go with another pension scheme. Imagine what they're like when it's actually time to pay out!,,,,,,1.0,

Not been an easy company to deal with when you retire and want to draw your money out. Absolutely everything has to be done over the phone as they lock you out of your account. Extra forms required that are not indicated at the point you highlight your retirement date.

"Hi,
First, I would like to highlight I am not the kind of person writing reviews. But here I am, frustrated and upset with [Company X].
My story: I used to have 4 different pensions (Aviva, Scottish Widow, Fidelity and [Company X]) which I consolidated into one. The consolidation has been very straight forward and my new pension providers were able to transfer the capital to them with minimum information from my side... expect for [Company X]. The [Company X] transfer to date has been an absolute nightmare: they are asking you to complete a form with information I have no idea they are using for + a proof of ID you need to send them (and they send it back). The full process take 10 working days since the reception. In comparison, my other pensions got transferred in 5 working days.
They make this process unnecessarily difficult, and I cannot find other explanation than doing it on purpose to discourage you to do it.
The issue is not their exiting process, it is their mindset. And if all their internal processes are as ""customer focused"" as this on, I would be worried on onboard with them.",,,,,,1.0,

I have asked repeatedly for the tax to be returned. I have raised the same issue with my tax office and have hit the same brick wall.

What a mistake! I wanted a solution that's simple and quick to set up, and easy to make payments into etc. The reality was quite the opposite. It's complicated to set up and assumes a level of prior knowledge I just didn't have. Also, the web app is horrible to navigate. But [Company X] is a (pseudo?) Department of the Civil Service, so I shouldn't have expected anything other than unnecessary bureaucracy, I guess.",,,,,,1.0,

"Think twice
I took a decision to transfer my smaller pension pots to [Company X] as my employer was enrolled in this scheme.
All was OK until the last of my transfers.
It took 9 months, [Company X] were asking me to call my provider as they were saying they couldn't get through.
This was a repeated process [Company X] asked me to do.
They confirmed they had requested funds on several occasions, but no one followed this up with my provider.
Well I did, they confirmed no details had been received from [Company X].
Again I called [Company X], again [Company X] asked me to get in touch... This continued for months..... 9 months.
I have made at least 12 calls and tx to [Company X] trying to ask what the issue was.
I have made a complaint about the total mess this turned into.
Again.. my complaint has taken 4-5 months... (still on going)
I keep getting excuses and target dates to resolve my issue keep getting put back.
It's not rocket science to listen in on my calls and look at my email threads, but even this seems to be above them.

I HAVE TOTALLY LOST CONFIDENCE IN [Company X], STAFF DON'T HAVE A CLUE, MANAGEMENT DON'T EITHER.

"One great thing is that you can make adhoc contributions. This is fantastic.

One big gripe is /was that when I tried to transfer in money from a different pension pot, it took months and I had to constantly ring up to find out what was happening, and to move things forward. it should have been a simple process but it was a 6 month bureaucratic nightmare. It was infuriating.

One little thing that I would really like would to be able to see a simple at-a-glance annual statement of how much has been contributed over the year and by who.",,,,,,1.0,
"[Company X] issued my annual statement in May this year. It was incorrect. They showed my prior year contributions in the performance field to attempt to show a higher performance.

I issued an email within 2 days and I keep getting fed incorrect information. They have now admitted their system is wrong and pulling out incorrect information after I insisted on getting this dealt with. I have spent over 30 hours trying to get it resolved with a new annual statement to no avail. I finally had a call from a supervisor yesterday who said ""annual statements are produced by a third party and I have no idea when you will receive the revised one!"" I suspect they still have a system problem and can't resolve it. Can you believe someone actually said that to me? If I said that to a customer, I wouldn't expect to have any customers. It's poor!

I have been lied to, I have had six calls which they were supposed to call and haven't done so. I keep getting pushed from pillar to post. I issued a complaint and was told yesterday that I should be getting a call today from the Complaints Department. It hasn't happened. Another failed call.

I have stated that I want to speak to the CEO who is hiding behind her call centre. She should be coming out and apologising for the system errors and advising when it will be rectified. Please check the accuracy of your annual statement including fund performance. This fund is not performing and is considered poor.

I have written to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my MP and the Pensions Regulator. The CEO is leading a poorly run organisation and there is much training needed within the call centre and how to treat pension members. This is my pension fund and they are falsifying information and not taking any responsibility for it.

"Awful experience. Very poor website, ignore messages (even complaints), the web chat feature is shockingly bad, latency of messages appearing shows that it's clearly going half way around the world and back (round trip in excess of 30 seconds).

Security is also really poor. The website log on page even has a button that lets you show your password. The guy on the phone I spoke to (when I couldn't access my account) actually advised me NOT to use a secure password vault and to use a password that I would remember. When you consider that there's no multi-factor authentication with their website, this is really, really bad practice. Anyone able to look at someone's facebook or twitter bio could therefore easily guess your password.

This is people's pensions we're talking about. Not logging on to the local pub to book a table. This goes against all standards for securing websites.

So, not only is their website bad (I couldn't log on), their phone service is even worse. The automated system has 20 - 30 second delays between each statement. It's, by some way, THE WORST, automated system I've used.

This all makes me feel this is a con and an illegitimate pension scheme. I know this isn't the case but it has the feel of one.

I have now been trying for a whole year to 1) get my account merged as there was an extra account accidentally made for me by an employer due to a spelling mistake (this must happen all the time), and then 2) make transfers in. Two very simple requests. I have spoken to at least 15 people at [Company X] over the last year who have promised me each time that my accounts would be merged and to check back in in two weeks as this will be when the accounts will be merged and the transfers in could be made.

I was also hung up on by two different people when they 'put me on hold' as they had to work out the 'complex nature' of the situation.

All other pension schemes who I had applied for transfers in from have now written to me to say that I am unable to progress with the transfers in for another year as they never heard back from [Company X] and you can only apply for transfers once a year. So [Company X]'s inability to do their job has had a big knock on effect.

As a result I finally decided I would just leave and move to a completely different scheme but in order to leave, my accounts have to be merged. Alas, I am still waiting for my accounts to be merged so that I finally don't have to deal with [Company X] ever again.

"Probably the best none user friendly website on earth, customer service may as well be robotic and no one can help you regarding anything.

Now in my account there's no help or customer service to take a payment as each time i clock on the website link to pay it ways not accessible, or not available, yet there's no customer service. Pension regulator is breathing down my collar after them grassing on me like the little incompetent fools they are, they then turn around and tell me i cant make payment until 6 working days.

Not only are they not even UK based customer service for UK pensions for UK people, no they are based in India and try to apply full outsourcing automation to a website that is completely none user friendly.

Delegate numbers, Direct debit mandates, amendments, share and reports NO.......Accountant submits schedule i pay its simple. I already hate paying pensions and strictly disagree with treating every employee like a baby having to put away baby savings because they are to incompetent to save for them selves like ADULTS, and this whole scenario puts me on the verge of a heart attack. i am ENFURIATED.
You and your little pension regulator reports can kiss my behind, you need to sort your selves out big style and work if your going to run around reporting people to the pension regulator, how about adding someone to the online chat that doesn't talk like a robot or doesn't give you generic replies because they are reading pre set scripts somewhere in India. I am sure as you demand so much from the UK employer, you should utilise UK based call centres and create UK jobs, NO ? or am i wrong, are you like the rest of them caught up in your pathetic little world where you hammer the employer for everything he or she has and puts the employees on a big victimised pedis tool leaving the employer to look like a savaging greedy money huger when in reality its the employees that cant save for their own future, its low end employees who can manage their finances properly, who have uncontrollable spending and i should pay for their complete disregard for their future and financial wellbeing â¦..via one of the stupidest websites i have ever been on.",,,,,,1.0,

"This company is truly awful. I'm trying to transfer my cash out of my workplace pension to my own SIPP. They have made it so difficult and put up barriers at every stage based on compliance reasons (I've held senior positions in banks, and they don't need to do the level of KYC checks for transferring money out!). So here is what I've experienced:

1. They SAY have an automated pension transfer programme which isn't automated.
2. My SIPP provider sent them transfer details. They declined it and didn't tell me. Apparently, my new pension provider got one piece of data wrong. I went through three layers of Phone verification giving them my member number, national insurance number and date of birth just to get through on the phone and then be told they cancelled the request. They couldn't change the data their side even though I corrected them and had been through validation. So because they cancelled the transfer application my provider had to send another one!
3. Transfer details received and correct - it's been three weeks now since I started the process. I get told by my SIPP provider that [Company X] needs more info. No message from [Company X]!
4. Get on the phone - they tell me they will send an email shortly for what they need. Not sure why i'm chasing them? How can my SIPP provider know before I do?
5. Now get the email 24 hours later. A long form that I have to print off and then post. In addition, I have to send a CERTIFIED photocopy of my ID. How am I going to be able to do that in Lockdown?

It's a joke. Anti-Money laundering checks are carried out by the institution taking your money, not from the institution sending the money. Even in case of fraud risk i've been through 3 layers of identification on the phone - they have clear instructions from me to release the funds recorded over the phone.

Don't quote compliance reasons to someone who deals with them on a daily basis!",,,,,,1.0,

"Our business has been using [Company X] pensions for around 4 years now and as with everything, it was a little daunting for a small business such as ours to get to grips with as first. But, as we got used to doing all the weekly and monthly routine things like making sure the schedules were correct and the amount to pay was checked, and submitting the payments on time, we grew in confidence. As and when hiccups arose (as they naturally do in anything!) we gradually learnt more about how to correct entries, how to manually enter the schedules, how to negotiate our way around the website. And when something has happened that we have not been confident about sorting ourselves, we have entered into WebChat with the on-line advisors, who have been more than happy to help. When the auto enrolment into workplace pensions first came out, we heard a lot of small businesses say ""I will let my accountant deal with those!"", but actually a small business can deal with it themselves - have confidence, it really is possible to cope with this alongside your wages (we use SAGE Payroll) the two programs together, put you at the helm of control.",,,,,,1.0,

The fault, they allege must therefore lie with our email server (denied by our server), but no they can't send a test email to the server, no they can't send an email to one of my other addresses, no they can't access the account manually.

"Dreadful company - avoid if you possibly can, although that may be more difficult than it sounds.

I was unwillingly enrolled into [Company X] by my employer in August and have been trying unsuccessfully to escape their limpet grasp ever since. Emails are ignored. Live text messaging on their site is tremendously unhelpful. They cannot opt me out unless I can tell them an ID number that I don't know. They are completely unable to identify me by my name, address, postcode, NI number, date of birth or anything else. Only the unknown number will do. I therefore resorted to writing them a traditional letter asking them to opt out. Eventually a reply arrives which, bizarrely, tells me triumphantly that I can't opt out because I ""have requested"" to be enrolled! Real Alice in Wonderland topsy turvy stuff. All I've ever wanted is for [Company X] to go away, leave me alone and stop taking money from my minimum wage that is sorely needed to feed my kids. Absolutely impossible they say.

I've also asked them many times to delete all of my data and details from their databases in line with the Data Protection Act, which requires that a data subject give their consent to the processing of their data. They've also refused to meet that legal obligation.

Always just one more form to fill out and send, then miraculously another, then another! Endless phone calls and time wasted on hold only to be told the wrong information and then when you chase the funds, hey presto, another form or piece of information they need. I have my own automated pension with nest and once I have finally settled my mums account I will be transferring my funds to another pension.

"If you take an active interest in your pension, [Company X] is far behind alternative providers (e.g. HL, Fidelity, Barclays) in terms of functionality and information. It's also more expensive overall than my SIPP provider because of the high contribution charges and the limited choice of funds. In addition, there's no way to see your funds performance over time, or who / what your fund is invested in, or where it is invested. If you have other investments elsewhere it's impossible to tell if your over-invested in something. The platform is outdated and difficult to use - although that is often because the information you expect to navigate to isn't actually provided. Would not use platform out of choice, and strongly recommend others (and employers) to look elsewhere if you take active interest in pension.

I'm sure you are doing your best, however there is lot's of different people using this fund, some more engaged than others, now is the chance to break the mould of the standard fund and engage a little more than a quarterly update.

Missing the extra star because of a few things. One problem is that [Company X] do not warn or clamp down on employer's paying late. I get paid weekly my contributions come out of my wages weekly but my employer leaves it up to 10 weeks before its invested into my [Company X] fund choice! This means both [Company X] and me personally are losing out on what could be invested. Over a persons lifetime this could be thousands lost for the employee. I have made complaints to both [Company X] and my employer but nothing gets done about it. The second is the lack of a direct telephone number to a specific department. Overall fund choices and the way i can view my pot is great.

It's really really simple but they have made it so complicated. I thought this was a UK company so am shocked to see it actually being run in India. No disrespect meant but when it comes to pensions you really need staff who can speak and understand English clearly to communicate. They have stolen my money and have told me eventually that it will take 7 days just to get a decision on wether I can get a refund or not for the money stolen from me and then another 4 weeks to receive a refund if they grant it.

Recently I was made aware of the fact that I had a private pension that was not performing and decided to transfer the balance into [Company X].

Not being very good with technology I made amess of the application. On calling for help, after quite a long wait I spoke to Dave. Not only did he explain the process that I had originally misunderstood but gave me information which made me approach the transfer in of funds in a slightly different way.

I request it is improved, please.
2. Why do [Company X] not employ more British people. Not correct that calls are diverted overseas, is it!! Come on you can answer this in public on here. I am very determined now, since I became frustrated by the fact I could hear such a long delay when I rang in and the fact that there is so much unemployment in the UK, and will continue to campaign about this happening in [Company X] and other UK companies.

Now I know where I was born, I remember my first pet and my mothers maiden name and my eldest's middle name, there are others but frankly I find it alarming that I know the answers yet The System records a fail, prob my fault but customer help would save this. What remains unanswered is why, I think, calls are diverted overseas and why the service is so poor, in my opinion. I will add that the fees charged are high, a previous poster was advised they have the option to cancel... in, I think, one month after enrollment... I shall translate this, have our pension and pay heavily for the privilege or go without because the mainstream pension fund providers only want large clients so if your employer doesn't fit the options are [Company X] or [Company X], as I understand it anyway. [Company X] have actually stated in writing that they need to fund the set up costs and this will be paid for by deductions from early investors, I shall translate this, pay for our inefficiencies until enough people notice and make some noise that forces change.

Firstly they had my NI number wrong, how ! this is surely the most important bit of information for your pension .

Eventually set up my online account. Started the process of transferring pension to Standard Life , and received an important message to my mail box .

Tried to log into account , canât log on ! Ring for help and Iâm told by a very rude woman that I never set up my online account ( made out I was an idiot ) told her again that I had set the account up . She says , no you havenât Iâm trying to help you . Help me?! This would involve actually listening to the sequence of events .

Eventually spoke to a gentleman who told me the account had now been closed because the money had been transferred . Far enough , so I did have an online account it had been closed !

The money has not arrived into my other pension pot yet , so why is my online portal closed . Why send a message to my email saying you have an important messages which you canât access .

Be glad never to deal with this company again . How does the government recommend this pension provider is beyond me !!

"I've transferred my [Company X] pension to another provider in December [PhoneNumber]. Before the money got transferred, I made a private contribution, which got lost in transfer. I've contacted [Company X] pension several times, spending at least 30minutes up to an hour on hold, every time I tried to get to talk to someone.

When I told them about the situation and the money that wasn't transferred to the new provider, they said the money arrived on their end too late to be transferred to the new provider. Instead of returning that money, they just kept it. Even though I contacted them in December, I've still not gotten my money back. They now say that my bank details provided were wrong, but even after giving them my bank details again for the second time, I've not gotten my money back.
The money was with [Company X] since December19, which means they had the money for over 4 months now.

I've contacted nest on all ways possible, phone, email (where I got an auto reply to log into my nest account, but since I transferred, I cannot login), facebook messenger etc. and if I ever get a reply it's always to contact them over the phone, which means I have to spend at least another hour of my life on hold.

"I lived in UK [PhoneNumber] after working as a Teaching Assistant in London and Manchester. Luckily I didnât use [Company X] Pensions for too long.

I am now living back in my home country of Australia and have been talking with family about retirement funds which reminded me of my experience with [Company X] Pensions. I left the UK at age 25 and they would not release my money, however small amount which I believe was under Â£100, until I turn 55. I explained I was not a resident nor had plans to return to the UK. They still denied my request to close the account.

I thought this was okay but now Iâm older and wiser I see it is not right as they must be taking advantage of so many people, as evidenced on this site! I suspect they are hoping non-UK residents will forget about their pension.

So my question is, with so many people complaining about this company is there a particular organisation or department with which this can be flagged with as their business model seems to be taking advantage of people, even in times of a global pandemic.

"I'm just going to copy the message I just sent them to TRY to opt out:

To whom it may concern,

This is the second time that the time comes for me to opt out of [Company X].
I fully understand that my employer has to re-enrol me by law every 3 years.

What escapes me is how in the name of the Flying Spaguetti Monster your service is so utter crap. I had to give you a proper rant last time to opt out and this time it will be worse:

The first option to opt out, after navigating the multiple attempts to confuse you that the website offers, is a fecking infinite cycle of loging in to verify it's you - you already have an account, click here to see it - click on opt out - loging in to verify its you - etc. WHY DO YOU HAVE OPT OUT AS AN OPTION IN YOUR WEBSITE IF IT DOESN'T WORK!!! THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS!!!

Option 2 after the first test of patience: Live chat. After buffering for like 10 minutes, they put you on a live chat with... a F***ING MACHINE! As helpful as tits on a fish. It takes about 5 minutes for the user to be able to send a sentence, and obviously the answers are just links to their crappy unhelpful website.

Option 3 is calling a [PhoneNumber] number to rip you off further.

I am option for option 4 in the hope that the person reading this (who, despite working for an evil mind that just wants to watch the world burn, probably has done nothing wrong and is just reading lots of similar messages like this one ever day) could help me opt out before my money gets stolen against my will again.

"[Company X] as a Pension company are great with the investments and look after your money well.

As for admin and help they are fairly poor as you see below, however they are no different to many other of the workplace pension providers. If schemes are not set up correctly at first or managed correctly this leads to many questions/issues from both employers and employees, like most of the reviews I have read below.

If as an employer you do not have the in-house expert use your accountant (if they have one) if not use a Workplace Pension Administration company such as autoenrolme @gmail.com

We look after numerous [Company X] schemes for employers and are fully aware of the admin issues, but through years of experience we have many work rounds and understand the systems. If you are an employer then email us and we may be able to help by taking on the admin for your scheme at a very reasonable yearly fee. Else feel free to email us and maybe we can respond with a simple reply on how to fix your issue.

The Workplace pension law is fairly straightforward if you employ anyone who is aged between 22 and state retirement age (eg 67) and they earn over Â£833 gross per month they HAVE to go into a compliant pension scheme, but they can then opt out (if they do so within 5 weeks of enrolment they will get back any contributions they have made - not the employers)

The Employer has to pay (*currently as a minimum) 3% on earnings between Â£512 and Â£4,167 pm

The Employee pays 5% (will see 4% off the gross bandings above - as the other 1% [being 20% of 5%] is claimed back by [Company X] as Tax Relief)

Please note that after 3 years of an employers ""Staging Date"" there is a re-enrolment process ie put everyone who is eligible back in again (but please note they can opt out again) letters from the employer are needed to explain to employees and a declaration with The Pension Regulator is also required to be completed.",,,,,,1.0,

"So I was placed into this pension scheme via my employer a few days ago. I was informed I would have the option to opt out once I had a live account. My account went live and I registered as instructed, then the trouble started.

In their help menu it states just how simple it is to âopt outâ of the pension scheme. You simply go to your home page and scroll down and select âopt outâ. Sounds simple and pretty straight forward right? â¦ Wrong!

Firstly when logging on to their portal there is no âopt outâ option located on their homepage at all, which is supposed to be readily available. If you try to reduce your pension payments, then you are unable to complete the request â¦ However if you try to increase it, then the portal is more than willing to accommodate this change (funny thing that).

I took screen shots of their help page and the of my home page showing no âopt out optionâ, as things were not looking to good by this point for â[Company X] Pensionsâ. I emailed them via the online portal from my messages box but received no response. I managed to log into the live chat about 24 hours later and spoke to âValintinoâ, who when presented with my questions, never actually answered any of them, other than repeating âIâm sorry for your inconvenienceâ. Now when I explained the situation to Valentino and that I wanted to opt out, he presented me with a strange option (that apparently I hadnât already tried, which I had!) he said âWhy donât you try logging into your account and refreshing your account pageâ â¦ Wow itâs that simple? Now bare in mind that I had in-fact logged in and out numerous times and refreshed the page numerous times and there was no option to âopt outâ â¦ Well funnily enough when I refreshed the page this time, as if by magic the âopt outâ option appears.

Now the [Company X] Pension is Government backed scheme and with the amount of money pumped into it, Iâm pretty sure these are not just basic glitches on their site, this is coming across to me (and many many other people) that it is a con set up to keep people enrolled in their pension plans.

What has been provided is Fraudulent Misrepresentation which occurs when someone makes a statement that-
â¢ they know is untrue, or,
â¢ they make without believing it is true, or,
â¢ they make recklessly (i.e. that person does not care about whether the statement is true or not).
This statement has been made via their online portal where information is supposed to be readily available on their site and options are meant to be in place and located on home pages which are not. You try to work around it and you are cut off at the pass when the site sees that you are trying to decrease payments but allows you to proceed if you wish to increase payments. Telephone calls find you cut off mid-way through waiting, ID numbers donât work to log in. Emails address coming in as incorrect, amongst many others, then when you do finally get through and argue with them then options become readily available on your account.
Not good enough at all and is coming across as a Government backed scam as it currently stands. I am not alone in dealing with them, as there is plenty of reviews on âTrust Pilotâ and other forums to back this up.
Be very careful for anyone who gets entered into this scheme, my advice is to âopt Outâ as soon as you can. Hammer them with Live chat, hammer them with phone calls, and E-mails until you are out. When you are out, be sure to save all chat logs, phone calls and e-mails as there is situations where they have denied accounts being cancelled and then you are over your 30 day opt out clause.",,,,,,1.0,

I have never been so frustrated with a company in my life. I was unlawfully enrolled by accident by my employer when I was underage and I have never been able to opt out since.

"I've worked in a couple of places since the new pension regulations came into effect and therefore have used a couple of different pension schemes, [Company X] is by far the worst.

In fact, the reason why I'm still with them is because IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSFER YOUR MONEY OUT OF IT. Every time I try to consolidate my pensions they make me jump through a different hoop. This hoopla has been going on for over five years now and the stress is such that I'm tempted to just leave the money. Which I'm guessing is what they want?

You're likely to not have a say in which scheme your employer chooses but if you are an employer and you don't hate the people working for you, don't go with [Company X]. I know it's cheap for you but it is bureaucratic, inflexible, unethical and just mean spirited towards us.",,,,,,1.0,

"I thought I was perhaps in the minority regarding my appalling service from [Company X] employees, then when I came here to leave a review I discover that this is the norm!! Probably the worst customer service and employee attitude I have come across. They are obstructive at every point possible and behave as if the money they hold is actually theirs. They have innumerable stages for you just to withdraw YOUR OWN contributions which you are fully entitled to do. At each point they have apparently been given a 5 day SLA (seemingly by the Government) when in a normal commercial environment these stages would be in minutes/hours. They take each 5 day stage as their target norm to aim at and use it to the maximum. 5 days from receipt of their requested proof of I.D. to actually accept it, this would actually take minutes to validate. Having accepted the proof of I.D. they then have a further 5 days to make a decision on when your withdrawal can take place. Having made the decision the date of withdrawal is then put......yes 5 days forward. At this point they then send the money by BACS which they almost laughingly inform you takes.......yep, 5 days!!
An SLA is supposed to be there to be the outside time if a few things go wrong yet they are allowed to use it at every stage as their norm hence any process takes the absolute maximum time. If this business was genuinely private it would be litigated daily as well as being punished by the regulator but because it was set up by the government it is allowed to carry on regardless. I have spoken to numerous employees and I would never have any of them within a thousand miles of any business I was involved in, effectively laughing at you from behind their 5 day shield.

I had to set up my own on line account using my unique number that [Company X] provided, which I did. I then had to send them my driving licence, passport and marriage certificate. But they said please only send copies as we cannot return, so that is what I did.
I was then informed that the information I had sent them did not pass their security checks and could I send them a bank statement. Well, I do all my banking on my phone and don't receive bank statements. I informed them of this and they then asked for a cancelled check. I asked them did they mean cheque? They said yes, I asked them who has cheque books now and did they know it was the 21st century? They replied that this would be the only other evidence that they would accept. But, I do have a cheque book and I sent them a cancelled cheque.

"[Company X] are by far the worst financial institution I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.
Six months before I reached retirement age [Company X] urged me to express my wishes regarding my pension.
As I had decided to cash in this pension on my retirement I duly informed [Company X] and at their request returned all the information and proof of ID etc they required.
What they failed to inform me was that as soon as I made my choice my online account would be closed irrevocably.
So six months before I retired I lost all access to my pension and I could no longer see any of the transactions taking place on my pension pot. They also stopped taking the voluntary contributions that I was making each month by direct debit.
As I did not trust my employer to be making the correct contributions to my pension pot and as [Company X] were once scammed out of Â£millions I felt vulnerable as I was being denied access to my account to see what was happening with my pension.
When I retired I did receive approximately the amount I was
expecting but I could not verify it was correct because they sent no supporting information or a statement or even a schedule of how much income tax had been deducted which I will require for my next tax return.

Really pleased with my [Company X] pension - they offer a good choice of funds, investment is market leading and they regularly win awards. Their fees are pretty low, compared to other providers and the communications are simple and easy to understand.

"I recently started with a company who uses [Company X] and the admin manager put me onto the system. It later transpired that I had been on it with a previous employer. Chaos ensued as I now had two [Company X] IDs. The admin manager rang them and endured the six million questions, but they needed to speak directly to me. I failed one of the security questions, which they said differed from their information. They could not tell which one I had got wrong and since they were all correct, I had no other answers to give, so they shut me out and said I could ring again in a few days. The next time they wanted to know what my previous [Company X] ID was to see if it was in accord with their documentation. I wasn't't aware I had had one so didn't know, but I was in the admin manager's office, so asked if they could speak to her. The answer was 'no' because it was my account and confidential. I gave them permission to speak to her with me there, but they wouldn't. Several calls later we asked to speak to the supervisor, who was immediately critical of the admin manager and couldn't see why there was a problem.
In total I have received five letters requesting the same information.

I received no reply.

I have escalated the matter to the ombudsman, and have now received a reply to my original two messages sent nearly 3 months ago, informing me I am only permitted to opt out during the 1st month. Which I did but this is not admissible, information that was not disclosed and I could not access as no information to access my online account.

It also has to be done manually every month - or if there is a way to automate it, I haven't found it.

I received a message saying a payment was overdue, even though I had made the payment, so I logged in and clicked on the relevant month showing overdue payment, and that took me to the contributions page. Even though the previous page had said overdue, this one said the sum had been paid and that the amount to pay was zero. However, it also said I should click Submit Schedule anyway even if the amount was zero. But the Submit Schedule button (and the others on that page) was greyed out and didnât do anything.

I noticed down below that it also said âYouâll need to save changes before you can make a paymentâ so I thought maybe that was the problem, but this button too is greyed our and inactive.

In exasperation I turned to the help pages. Having failed to find anything useful, I clicked the email icon offered. This did open up a new email to be composed, but with no destination address, because the Help page is mis-coded and doesnât have a destination address in the hyperlink.

"I took out a pension with [Company X] online, as I trusted it mainly because it was government backed. However, I strongly doubt if the online process I undertook is compliant in its fiduciary responsibilities towards me. I say this because I took out a pension that turns out to be a 'self employed pension'. I chose it, as it was described as an option for company directors.

It seems, from speaking to a financial advisor, that I should never have been offered a self employed pension as a director. I now can't get the money out, as I can't transfer it into the right type of pension for myself - the other pension providers don't accept a transfer in of this type. I have tried a number of providers, but they give the same response, that they can't accept this type of pension. ie. any pension that is the correct type for me, won't accept this one as its the incorrect type! [Company X] refuses to let me know which providers would accept their pension.

The other reason I would say they aren't performing their fiduciary duty is that I was never warned, when applying for the [Company X] pension, that this particular pension has a financial disadvantage in comparison to other pensions- the reason being is that any beneficiaries are taxed IHT from a [Company X] pension. Any other pension, the beneficiary sum is exempt from IHT.

I was never warned about this at any point in the process of taking out the pension online. I think this is dubious in the extreme.

I would also like to note that its very difficult to see the pension's performance on the website - I couldn't find it.

I don't think [Company X] should offer the online self-service to apply for a pension if they're: A) allowing people to take out the wrong type of pension by describing a self employed pension as a pension that company directors can take out and B) not warning people that they're the only pension that isn't exempt from IHT. C) not warning people of how difficult it is to remove the money in comparison to other pensions.
